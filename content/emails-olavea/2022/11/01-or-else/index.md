title: Say "or else" again and I'll make you cry 😿

Ahoy skill-builder pirate of Jamstackia!

👋😸🏴‍☠️

We saw the start of the backstory of my plugin workbook in my last letter so today we'll just keep going

«Say "or else" again and I'll make you cry.» Says Lizabeth

«Oh yeah!? We'll see who CRIES. Or else!» Says Lance-Lotta and puts Lizabeth in a headlock. The two are rolling on the floor as the door opens.

«Stop it!» A hissed whisper. «Now!» Louder, and yeah that's me, Merlina, mentor of these two reckless rascals and teller of this tall tale.

## TODO

Write up a sentence about your idea for your backstory and email it to Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) and me, that would help us a lot!

 🏴‍☠️😺👍

ARR!

Stay piraty 🏴‍☠️😺👍 and keep skill-builing!
