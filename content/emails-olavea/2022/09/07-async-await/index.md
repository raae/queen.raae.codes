## Adding "async and await" to sourceNodes is a sub-task

In my daily gatsby-plugin practice, I ONLY do one sub-task each session. Today's sub-task was:

- adding `async` to `exports.sourceNodes =` and
- `await createPiratyNodes(`

&nbsp;

I'll soon tell you WHY I do a daily sub-task, but first WHAT is a sub-task?

## WHAT is a sub-task?

That dev-task YOU did last week? Close your eyes and see your dev-task as a pink donut. Bite off a useless-on-it's-own sub-task. NOW you can chew it. Without choking on it \*

## HOW do you find your sub-task?

A. Look at a dev-task you did last week

B. Bite off a useless-on-it's-own sub-task

That's all 😺

## WHY do I do a daily sub-task?

Because MY dev-brain practice is more piraty on a tiny sub-task than on the whole dev-task.

## Here is my code before practice

```js
// gatsby-node.js

const piraty = `source piraty api here`;

const createPiratyNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) => {
  console.log(`create Piraty Nodes here`);
};

// Add async

exports.sourceNodes = (gatsbyUtils) => {
  // Add await

  createPiratyNodes(gatsbyUtils, piraty);
};
```

## After practice

```js
// gatsby-node.js

const piraty = `source piraty api here`;

const createPiratyNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) => {
  console.log(`create Piraty Nodes here`);
};

// Add async

exports.sourceNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) => {
  // Add await

  await createPiratyNodes(gatsbyUtils, piraty);
};
```

Try out a sub-task on your own dev-brain; it might make your practice more piraty 🏴‍☠️😺👍

ARR!

**P.S**

The next plugin-pirate letter will cover "How do you know what type of sub-task is right to bite off for your dev-brain?"

\* Some people CAN chew a whole donut without choking on it. Don't believe me? Dig up the video with Paul Scanlon winning a donut-eating contest against a Gatsby co-worker. You'll find the video somewhere [on Paul's twitter.](https://twitter.com/PaulieScanlon)
