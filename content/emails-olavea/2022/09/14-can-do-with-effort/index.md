title: Ola is doing a can-do-with-effort sub-task
---

Ahoy skill-builder pirate of Jamstackia!

We looked into one useless-on-it's-own sub-task in my last letter and I promised you this letter would be about "How do you know what type of sub-task is right to bite off for your dev-brain?" So how about I say:

To can't-do or NOT can't-do, that is the question.

🗣️ 💀

## Answer: a can't-do sub-task is bad for your brain

After years of piraty experimentation on the Pirate Princess my current conclusion is "a can't-do sub-task is bad for your brain", because it's stealing your focus like a pirate steals loot. So a can-do-with-effort sub-task is better for your focus and thus your dev-brain.

I'll soon tell you WHY a can't-do sub-task is stealing your focus like a pirate, but first WHAT is a can-do-with-effort sub-task?

##  WHAT is a can-do-with-effort sub-task?

You sometimes start out with a can't-do sub-task. Then after practicing a little, it becomes a can-do-with-effort sub-task. And Then after practicing a lot more you have a can-do-96%-reliably sub-task. Because you have finally nailed your sub-task into your dev-brain.

Imagine a white board with three parts
1. a can't-do sub-task
2. a can-do-with-effort sub-task
3. a can-do-96%-reliably sub-task

You write your sub-task on a yellow sticky note and move it from 1. to 2. and then to 3.

## WHY a can't-do sub-task is stealing your focus like a pirate?

Like me you probably also have many sub-tasks on your can-do-with-effort board. You need one less sub-task on your can-do-with-effort board. Because for each sub-task you have on your can-do-with-effort board the harder it is for your dev-brain to focus on nailing the sub-task your practicing in the moment. According to [Kathy Sierra's badass book Badass](https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra-ebook/dp/B00VAUIM18/), having too many sub-tasks on her can-do-with-effort board is The Number One thing stealing focus and wrecking the skill-buildership of developers.

## HOW do you find your can-do-with-effort sub-task?

A. Look up again a dev-task you did last week

B. Bite off a can-do-with-effort sub-task

Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of GO! 😺


## HOW did Captain Ola Vea Junior find Lillian's can-do-with-effort sub-task?

A. He looked up again a dev-task Lillian on our summer workation

B. He bit off a sub-task that Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) can-do-with-effort

Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of GO! 😺


## Example (Warning: summer workation tall tales alert! ☀️ 🗣️ 💬 🔈 )

Let's have a look at my slightly off topic, but weirdly handy example from our piraty summer workation.

## A can-do-with-effort sub-task for Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸)

Twisting the outboard engine handle:
- To go faster forward
- To go slower forward

## TODO

Write up an idea for a sub-task and email it to Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) and me, that would help us a lot! Bite off a can-do-with-effort sub-task from a dev-task you did last week.

 🏴‍☠️😺👍

ARR!

Stay piraty 🏴‍☠️😺👍 and keep practicing!

P.S
Next letter will be about "Decide to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain in one practice session"
