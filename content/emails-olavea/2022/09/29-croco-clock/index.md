title: could a croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ help you to focus like a pirate?
---

Ahoy skill-builder pirate of Jamstackia!

We looked into "Don't let Distraction Diaz distract you" in my last letter so today I'll show you my favourite focus tool to find out when your sub-task practice session is done. It's my great grandfather Captain Crook's croco clock. 🐊 ⏲️ We'll look at:

What a croco-clock is,
Why it can help you focus and
How you use it.

##  WHAT is a croco-clock 🐊 ⏲️ ?

A croco-clock 🐊 is for example an egg clock ⏲️ that goes ARRR! when your sub-task practice session is done.

Then you can stop

## WHY could a croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ help you to focus like a pirate?
Firstly you decide to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain. This is good for your focus.

Secondly by starting your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ you confirm to yourself your decision to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain

Thirdly, the clock is literally ticking and you know you have this ONE practice session to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain.

## HOW do you use your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ ?
1. You set your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ to for example 96 minutes
2. And place it in another room, especially if you are using your cellphone *
3. You do your sub-task in exactly the same way again and again
4. Keep doing your sub-task again and again until your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ goes ARRR! even past the point you feel you are already doing your sub-task 96%-reliably
5. Because you're a practice pirate and this sub-task will be YOUR treasure only when you have it automated into your dev-brain

Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of GO! 😺

## TODO

Write up a sentence about your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ experiments and email it to Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) and me, that would help us a lot!

 🏴‍☠️😺👍

ARR!

Stay piraty 🏴‍☠️😺👍 and keep practicing!
