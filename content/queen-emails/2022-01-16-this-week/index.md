title: This week around the Gatsby islands
emojii: 🏝 🗓

I had a great birthday, but for my 40th there will be a huge a\*\* party and [you are invited](https://twitter.com/raae/status/1480924823178121217) 🎉

As a birthday present, I am sure, Gatsby shipped [v4.5](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.5/) last week!

If you are a TypeScript fan you'll be pleased to find that Gatsby now ships with TypeScript types for `getServerData`.

Keen to speak at Gatsby Conf 2022?  
Make sure to submit your proposal by Friday's deadline.

I would also check out the [TheJam.dev](https://cfe.dev/events/the-jam-2022/) for next week. A two day community conference, now **free** of charge!
