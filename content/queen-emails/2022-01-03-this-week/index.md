At the end of the year, Gatsby released the dates for [Gatsby Conf 2022](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/announcing-gatsbyconf-2022/): March 2nd and 3rd. If you have a talk idea, their Call for Proposals (CFP) is open through January 14th.

I am starting off the year testing something new: Live Screencasts — concise, instructional videos on a single Gatsby topic.

Ola has committed to doing skill-building streams every Sunday for the next 100 weeks 🤯
