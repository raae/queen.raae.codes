In yesterday's unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunts in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands we looked at how to [modularize your site](https://youtu.be/26CDRdhXozo) with local plugins.

I have added timestamps to the description, so you can jump straight to [the why](https://youtu.be/26CDRdhXozo?t=261) or [the how](https://youtu.be/26CDRdhXozo?t=520) if you'd like.

The TLDR version of **why** is that [I like a tidy ship](https://youtu.be/26CDRdhXozo?t=1446).

When making a local plugin you'll add a plugins folder to your project and all folders inside of there will be your plugins if they contain a package.json file.

You use them the same way you would external plugins, by adding them to the plugins array in the gatsby-config.js file.

The name to use when configuring the plugin is the name of the plugin's folder inside plugins.

## Example

With the folder structure:

```

```

you may configure the local plugin like so:

```

```

**PS:** We got done super fast, but kept YOLO streaming. Check the [YouTube description]() for the timestamp to remote image sourcing for instance.
