## My Sunday Skill Builder Sessions:

This Sunday I did 2 live Skill-Builder-Sessions and the second was terrible! 🙀

I knew it waking up, so I prepared. I needed to prepare to keep myself un-distracted even when tired.

First my daily morning Skill-Builder-Session went well, because my mind is fresh, alone and un-distracted up in my labyrinthine loft. Just my code, my coffe and me.

But my second Skill-Builder-Session would be worse, because live coding is distracting. You know, making sure video and audio is ok. And comments, putting them on screen, reading them out loud, removing them from the screen. And then my own talking, getting carried away into a story for example. Distracting. But smooth sailing compared to later, in the dark and stormy night.

The terrible third session though, would find me physically and mentally tired for four reasons.

1. 08:00 PM is LATE for me, most normal days I am literally in bed reading a book about heros in ancient greece.

2. No coffee. For many hours.

3. I would have come straight up from a great tasting, but rich fish dinner cooked by the queen herself.

4. Before the dinner I would have come straight in from bicycling Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) to the wintry woods. Bicycling around after the skiing Pirate Princess between the ski tracks under snow-laden branches. And bicycling back home on icy and car-filled roads. Lovely, but tiring.

So I knew I'd be tired and distracted. How did I prepare to free up my mind to focus on only one coding step at the time?

## What did I do?

I used an acronym to name the steps om my task. I wrote «iACTiONS» on paper.

## Why did I do it?

Looking over at «iACTiONS» freed up my mind to focus on doing each step. Like i. id.

## How did I do it?

I wrote down the «iACTiONS» on paper like this:

i. id
A. actions
C. contentDigest
T. type
i. internal: {
O. (OLA_TUBE_ID)
N. node
S. singing

Every time I got distracted, I could just take a quick look at my paper. But because I KNEW my paper was there, I relaxed and stayed focused enough to remember that I was on «T. type» and get back to coding. I remeber this happening several times 💪😺.

💪😺👍

Keep your skill-builder-ship afloat this week!

P.S
Here is the video of my late night live Skill-Builder-Session starting 5 minutes when I start coding from «i. id» If you watch for 1 minute you will see gorgeous Giggles-the-pug in the video I am using the id from. Giggles is one of Sid's two dogs. Sid, formerly at Gatsby now at Cloudflare.
