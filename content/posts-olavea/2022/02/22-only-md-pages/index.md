title: Failed at "create pages only for markdown pages, not for markdown sections"
---

## My Sunday Skill Builder Session:

This Sunday, I tried to create pages only for markdown pages, not for markdown sections. On our POW! Website.

## What did I do?

I created pages with markdown files and the createPages hook from &#64;GatsbyJS

## Why did I do it?

Because it's tidier and because Queen Benedicte &#64;raae told me to do it.

## How did I do it?

The short version is I started out with my 1.2.3 A.B.C. mnemonic Gingerbread house.

1. Supplies: allMarkdownRemark.node
2. Bakingsong = bakingSong.js
3. Loop over the supply node and create a page

A. Ahoy! Aroma path!  
B. BakingSong is a component  
C. Catsby id is context

## What went wrong?

I'll get into what went wrong on Thursday at 7 pm CET!

That's right; I'll be live coding alone on our Gatsby Deep-Dives because the Queen and the Pirate Princess are skiing in the mountains. ⛰️⛷️
