title: Programatically create pages for tags from Sanity.io

## My Sunday Skill Builder Session:

## What did I do?

I followed the "red string" of one tag from the front end of the web app and all the way back to my backend in sanity.io.

## Why did I do it?

I want to use tags in a way that make it easier for Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) to finish her projects by shipping them to the internet — and then archiving her projects on my labyrinthine loft because it is good for skill-building to finish projects.

## How did I do it?

See this two-minute summary where I followed the "red string" of one tag from the frontend of the web app and all the way back to my backend in sanity.io.

If you feel like doing me a favor, you can give me a 🏴‍☠️ emoji comment to feed my youtube algos some vitamins.
