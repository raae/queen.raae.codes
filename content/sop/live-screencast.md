## Ideas

### 🔴 👩‍🏫 Deferred Static Generation (DSG) with #GatsbyJS · Live Screencast

Have so many pages your site takes forever to build? Let's make user of Deferred Static Generation (DSG) for the least visited pages!

### 🔴 👩‍🏫 Server Side Rendering (SSR) with #GatsbyJS · Live Screencast

Need to make sure the page gets fresh data on every load? Or maybe deny access to unauthorized users? Then Server Side Rendering (SSR) might be what you need!

### 🔴 👩‍🏫 Client Side Rendering (CSR) with #GatsbyJS · Live Screencast

Need to update content while the user is on the page? Is the user's data decrypted in the browser? If so Client Side Rendering (CSR) will be of use.
