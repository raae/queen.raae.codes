Thursday **September 16th** I am speaking about Gatsby Functions at Gatsby Fall Camp.

If you'd rather wait for when the YouTube recording is up, sign up for [emails from yours truly](/emails) and I'll let you know.

It's a short 15 minute talk, but there will still be a full code demo on how to charge money for time travels using Stripe, and how to let the travellers know if they found the princess or not using SendGrid.

Who is this princess, why time travelling? Sign up for [the backstory](/ruby) via email.

I would love to see a friendly face in the chat, I will be on at approximately 19:45 CEST. Sign up for the [event over on Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/camp-fall-2021/).
