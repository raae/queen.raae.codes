**September 16th** I spoke about Gatsby Functions at Gatsby Fall Camp.

Missed it? You may [register to watch the replay](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/camp-fall-2021), or sign up for [emails from yours truly](/emails) and I'll let you know when the recording is up on YouTube.

It was a short 15 minute talk, but there was a full [code demo](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-fall-camp-2021) on how to charge money for time traveling using Stripe, and how to let the travellers know if they found the princess or not using SendGrid.

Who is this princess, why time travelling? Sign up for [the backstory](/ruby) via email.
