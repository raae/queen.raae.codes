**September 16th** I spoke about Gatsby Functions at Gatsby Fall Camp.

If you would like to get notified when the YouTube recording is up, sign up for [emails from yours truly](/emails) and I'll let you know.

It's a short 15 minute talk, but there was a full code demo on how to charge money for time traveling using Stripe, and how to let the travellers know if they found the princess or not using SendGrid.

Who is this princess, why time travelling? Sign up for [the backstory](/ruby) via email.
