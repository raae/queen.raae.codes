## Why me?

- I have worked on Gatsby projects since 2018.
- I enjoy figuring out how to get the most out of the frameworks I use.
- I have been coding since 1995 and have been stuck on my fair share of reefs by now.
- I was chosen by Gatsby as a speaker for Gatsby Days 2020 and Gatsby Fall Camp 2021
- I am the winner of the Gatsby FuncJam 2021
- I have created apps trusted by the Swedish Armed Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and others.
