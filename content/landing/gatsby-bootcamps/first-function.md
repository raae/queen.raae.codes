## 🎶 A little bit of backend in your life 🎶

You are a front-end developer. You are eager to move backwards in the stack. You heard Serverless is an excellent place to start!

However you are weary of getting tangled up in **configuration h\*ll**&nbsp;(aws&nbsp;👀). Or maybe you've completed the `hello world` example, but could use some guidance on what to build next?

## 🎶 A little bit of Serverless on your side 🎶

Imagine being able to effortlessly develop and deploy Serverless functionality when needed.

Imagine knowing how to integrate with _all the things_ and how to handle secrets on the server 🔐

Imagine not needing to wait for the backend devs to move ahead with straight forward backend functionality.

## 🎶 A little bit of Gatsby is all you need 🎶

Newly released Gatsby Functions radically simplifies how to write and deploy Serverless functions.

It removes the need for complicated configuration, letting you focus on developing and deploying the functionality you need.

A student of the 5 week summer program replaced a paid product with a single function in his first week 🤯

## What you'll make?

**A TimeShip!**

One intended to find Pirate Princess Lillian, aged 11, to help break Lizabeth out of jail in London back in the year 1554.

Or in less creative terms:

- a Gatsby Serverless Function that takes data from a form and pushes it to a third party service
- a Gatsby Serverless Function that fetches the submitted date
- React code to displays the data on your page, and automatically updates with new data

If you are not into time-traveling, make the project your own or add similar functionality to your own existing Gatsby site.

## What you'll learn?

- How to approach writing a function and splitting it into manageable tasks
- The structure of a good Serverless function
- How to handle secrets both in development and production environments
- The joys of data validation and error handling!
- Calling/polling/requesting a Serverless function from your site
- How to deploy to Netlify or Gatsby Cloud
- Save and retreive data from a third party service
