## Learn how to add a develop and deploy a pay-what-you-want feature with Stripe

Watch me [blast through selling time travels](https://youtu.be/s2yjFq_wDsE) for 1000 USD a pop in 15 minutes at Gasby Fall Camp&nbsp;'21&nbsp;🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️

If you would like to learn how to create a pay-what-you-want feature at a slower pace, with live support and group accountability — [join the boot camp](#join), and I'll **guarantee** you'll have your **pay-what-you-want feature deployed** by the end of the week 💪

## What you'll build

**A TimeShip**

I'll provide you with TimeShip starter files, and you'll add the needed pay-what-you-want functionality, including fulfilling the travel by sending out a fun pdf through SendGrid.

Or in less creative terms:

- a Gatsby Function that creates a Stripe Checkout Session
- a Gatsby Function used as a webhook by Stripe to fulfill the order
- a Gatsby Function to fetch a Stripe Checkout Session
- a Server-Side Rendered (SSR) Confirmation page

If you are not into time-traveling, make the project your own or add similar functionality to your own existing Gatsby site.

## What you'll learn?

- How to approach the project and split it into **manageable tasks**.
- The **structure** of a typical Serverless function.
- How to **handle secrets** both in development and production environments.
- The joys of **data validation** and **error handling**!
- How to **deploy** to Netlify or Gatsby Cloud.
- What **webhooks** are and how to make them using Gatsby Functions.
- How to create **Stripe Checkout Sessions** server-side to support **pay-what-you-want** and add metadata used in fulfillment.
- When to use a **Server-Side Rendered** (SSR) page.
