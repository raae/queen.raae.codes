I have been having fun on the web with code since the late '90s.

The person who first introduced me to HTML was my Norwegian teacher, and since then:

- I have completed a Master in Computer Science
- Built apps trusted by the Swedish Armed Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and others.
- Created POW! â€” the encrypted menstrual cycle journal made with Gatsby and many other skill-building side projects.
- Spoken at both Gatsby Days and Gatsby Camp, in addition to RuhrJS, JSConf Budapest, and more.

Last but not least, I started live-streaming my coding resulting in the weekly YouTube show Gatsby Deep Dives with Queen Raae and the Nattermob Pirates.

Sleek and "professional" I am not. My thing is informal, energetic, and fun. Failing code is part of the process, and together we figure out how to fix it. No need to conform to any ideas of how a coder should be or act; come as you are!
