## What's included?

The Mini Bootcamp Command Central is a private GitHub repo you'll get access to, and keep access to until the end of the year (at least).

### Forum

_24/7 access_

The Discussions tab of the private GitHub repo will be our forum. There you may ask questions, discuss possible solutions and get to know the other current (and former) students.

### Assignment + Starter Files

_Saturday 10:00 CEST_

Weâ€™ll start the week with a couple of days for you to try your hands at coming up with a solution on our assignment on your own, I promise it will make the live webinar so much more valuable!

### Live Webinar

_Tuesday 20:00 CEST / 11:00 PST - 1.5 hour_

See how a Gatsby Function is made from start to finish in the live webinar where I code through a complete example solution to our assignment. The recording will be made available.

### Co-working session

_Wednesday 10:00 CEST - 3 hours_

Highly optional, but if you need some accountability, we'll be there to make sure you stay on task. We check in with each other 3 times but mostly work silently (virtually) side-by-side.

### Code Sample

_Thursday 10:00 CEST_

The live webinar code will be available as a Pull Request in the private GitHub repo. Feel free to comment and ask questions directly on the Pull Request.

### Celebratory Q&A Session

_Saturday 20:00 CEST / 11:00 PST - 1 hour_

Bring your questions, code, and or celebratory beverage to this live Q&A session.
