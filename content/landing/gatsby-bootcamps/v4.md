**Still confused by the new rendering modes?**

There used to be only one rendering mode: Static Site Generation (SSG).

With Gatsby v4 we got Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Deffered Static Generation (DSG).

Learn how and when to use Gatsby's new rendering modes SSR and DSG with real work examples with my upcoming bootcamp.
