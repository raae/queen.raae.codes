## Imagine a never-ending pipeline of content

Imagine this ‚Äì No more worrying about what to post on social media. No more worrying about what to write in your newsletter. No more ifs, buts, or maybes. Just show up and enjoy the ride!

All you need to do is show up and talk about what you know best: your Dev Tool! Queen Raae has 30 years of experience sailing the World Wide Web and will be by your side every step of the way.

Imagine having our team transform that biweekly commitment into a never-ending pipeline of content to share with your audience.

<aside class="pow">

Close that "I should do some marketing" loop in your mind and get back to what you do best: building your Dev Tool!

</aside>

Live streaming is uniquely authentic. It's you, talking about what you know best, your Dev Tool. Without the veneer of marketing speak or rehearsed sales pitches. It's the perfect way to connect with your audience and build trust. Especially in the early days.

## Here's How It Works

We start with an exploratory call. We'll talk about your Dev Tool, your audience, and your goals. We'll also workshop the concept for your live streams: office hours, live coding, product update chats or a combination of these.

After the exploratory call, you choose your package, and we'll get to work refining the concept and producing the marketing material needed: templates for social media, thumbnails, clips etc. You may be as involved as you want to be in this process, or completely hands-off!

Then all you need to do is show up for the scheduled streams every other week. Don't worry, we know you are busy so we'll send you reminders and there is no need to prepare ahead of time. We'll spend 15 minutes before going live to get you ready and comfortable.

Between the streams, we'll fill your content pipeline with clips, quotes, and other marketing material depending on the package chosen. Again you may be completely hands-off, or review every draft before it goes out.
