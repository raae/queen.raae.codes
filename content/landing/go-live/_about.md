## Why me?

I love live streaming, it energizes me and will make you relax and be the human you are. Not the robot that often comes out if you were to preparpe a presentation.

- I started experimenting with live streaming in 2018,
- and since 2020 I have live streamed regularly on YouTube: 150+ streams and counting.
- Since 2021 I have also co-host the Slow&Steady podcast where we've interviewed guests about their journey as founders in addition to our more regular chatting about work and life episodes.

I am also an engineer, so I'll get what you are talking about or at least be able to ask the right questions:

- I have coded since 1995 and have been stuck on my fair share of reefs by now.
- I hold a Master of Computer Science from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
- I enjoy figuring out how to get the most of the tools and technologies, and share it with others.
- I have created apps trusted by the Swedish Armed Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and others.
