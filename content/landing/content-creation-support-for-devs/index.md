# Are your devs STUCK with their content creation? 🤔

You know it’s important for your users to find technical content from devs like themselves. You know devs creating useful technical content require support. BUT do you know what kind of support EACH of your devs need with their content creation?

## Imagine your dev team publishing REGULARLY 🤹‍♂️

Imagine this – Imagine your devs UNSTUCK. Imagine your users giving positive feedback about the “super useful technical content” your dev team is creating. Imagine knowing exactly how to support EACH of your devs so they keep creating and keep smiling.

## Content creation is fun with Queen Raae by your side 😃

Get You Devs Unstuck – Sometimes what it takes to get unstuck is to get help with … almost EVERYTHING. Let MY team do all the "boring" stuff so that YOUR devs only have to SHOW UP and talk to Queen Raae about everyday work stuff. No preparation. No procrastination.



## Book a live 1-on-1 call with me now,  👩‍🏫

I’ll tell you how this might work for your dev team and you.

Why Queen Raae?

- I’ve been running a dev team that has been doing content creation for 9+ years
- I have published 100+ videos, blog-posts and newsletters for devs just like your users


Playfulness with coding has been our strength for over ten years, so we’re pretty good at it
Everything sounds like a lot, but ask yourself “how much is your dev team’s time worth to you?”



### Here’s How It Works:
You book a call with me using my private scheduling link. Our meeting is set for 60 minutes, but you might want to block out extra time in case we go a little long. Our call will take place over Whereby. You share your biggest content creation challenge with me. I will give you specific instructions about what to do next.

Typical areas of interest include:

- How to create better content with suport
- How to increase content creation skills by …
- How to create a … with …
- How to …




YOUR dev only has to show up on the live stream, if you let MY team do the rest 👩‍🏫

notes:
A good thing with streaming live is NO procrastinating. Another good thing is the audience commenting with relevant questions your devs know the answers to. Or maybe a question that inspires new ideas for solutions to coding problems your devs are already trying to solve. Yeah that’s all happened to us and those are some reasons why we LOVE live streaming.

if your devs get helped with EVERYTHING by a more experienced dev they trust.

(. Making a technical video is even harder, especially for a dev, introvert or not. But you already know that.
)


Your devs time is valuable, but not only the time, also the disruption in their day, sitting down trying to do an unfamiliar task like writing
they deserve premium support
would you let your customers try to solve unfamiliar problems with your tool without help and support
