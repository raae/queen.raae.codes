I hired Queen Raae to help my start-up with a really important project: demonstrating how our software can be integrated with a React application.

This was a highly technical project that **required a seasoned software engineer** to execute — and teach — well. She executed the project with very little oversight, taking the requirements and delivering solid solutions through her own trial, error, and understanding of our SDK.

It allowed us to deliver an important project that will **benefit our customers for a long time to come**, cost-effectively and without pulling our engineers away from their other work.

I could not be more pleased with the results, and I’ll actively look for opportunities to work with Queen Raae again.
