## Why me?

- I have worked on Stripe projects since 2018.
- I enjoy figuring out how to get the most out of the frameworks I use.
- I have been coding since 1995 and have been stuck on my fair share of reefs by now.
- I have created apps trusted by the Swedish Armed Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and others.
