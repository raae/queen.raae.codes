## Who am I and why choose me to review your code?

Hi! I am Queen Raae, a seasoned web developer who loves duct-taping together side projects in addition to making apps trusted by the Swedish Armed Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and others.

I have followed Gatsby closely since 2018 and here are some hopefully compelling reasons as to why you should choose me to review your code:

- Experience publishing Gatsby Plugins to the npm Registry and creating a plugin starter used by other developers with great success “@raae HUGE thanks for your gatsby-plugin-starter! I just started a new plugin and breezed through A LOT of boilerplate thanks to you and could focus on getting my project started instead 🙏” - tweet by davidpaulsson
- A solid presence in the Gatsy community with connections in the broader Jamstack ecosystem. Developers from both Gatsby and Netlify have been on our weekly "Unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunts in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands" on YouTube.
- “Executed the project with very little oversight, taking the requirements and delivering solid solutions through her own trial, error, and understanding of our SDK” - Geoff Roberts, Outseta
- Hired to upgrade the official Cloudinary plugins, making them Gatsby v4 compatible (and more).
