    title: Get another pair of eyes on your Gatsby project

## Need another pair of eyes?

**Imagine this â€“** Imagine understanding the current state of your Gatsby project. Imagine knowing how to steer away from common Gatsby pitfalls in the future. Imagine having a plan to ensure a stable Gatsby project.

**Imagine having a Gatsby expert review your code** and help you get there!

## Here's How It Works

In a virtual 30-minute meeting, you present your Gatsby project and the underlying challenges you are having. If you are not the lead developer, bring the lead developer!

After that, you give me access to your code, and I thoroughly review the whole code base.

After I finish the review, we schedule a one-hour review session where I present feedback on your Gatsby project and share tips for improvements and further development. You are free to record this session for future reference.
