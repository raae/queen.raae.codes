# Safely Exposing User Data with Row Level Security: The Profile Table Strategy

You're building a simple blog app where you want to show author avatars and usernames next to each post. Simple enough, right? Just grab the avatar from your user table and display it.

But then reality hits like a cold splash of database security awareness...

ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

If you make the user table publicly readable to show avatars, you'd also be exposing emails, potentially sensitive user metadata, and who knows what other private information. That's a hard no!

This article will show you a beginner-friendly solution to this common problem.

## The Problem: User Tables Are Private for Good Reason

The user table is usually a treasure trove of sensitive information, it typically contains information like:

- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Authentication tokens and metadata
- Login timestamps and activity logs
- Email confirmation status
- Password reset tokens
- And potentially custom user data you've collected

This is why you should never make your main user table publicly readable.

However that is exactly what you'd need to do to show avatars and usernames next to posts!

But that's like leaving your front door wide open because you want the pizza delivery person to see your house number ðŸ˜±

## The Solution: Separate Public and Private Concerns

A clear separation between your private authentication data and your public profile information is the solution.

Think of it like having two filing cabinets:
**Cabinet 1: Private User Data**

- Locked tight
- Contains emails, passwords, security tokens
- Only accessible to the system and the user themselves
- Never exposed to the public

**Cabinet 2: Public Profile Information**

- Selectively accessible
- Contains only information the user explicitly wants to share
- Usernames, display names, avatars, bios
- Can be safely viewed by anyone

### How This Works in Practice

You create a completely separate "profiles" table that:

1. **Links to your user account** - Each profile belongs to exactly one user account
2. **Contains only public information** - Username, display name, avatar, bio, etc.
3. **Has different privacy rules** - Can be read by anyone, but only modified by the profile owner
4. **Gets created automatically** - When someone signs up, they automatically get a basic profile

The beauty of this approach is that your authentication system stays completely locked down while your application features get the public data they need.

### Think Carefully About What Goes Public

Just because you _can_ put information in the public profile doesn't mean you _should_. Ask yourself: "Would this user be comfortable with this information appearing on a public business card?"

Examples of data that might seem harmless but could be problematic:

- Subscription or payment status
- Geographic location data
- Activity metrics or usage statistics

## Key Takeaways

- **Never make your main user table publicly readable** - it contains way more sensitive data than you think
- **Separate public and private concerns** by creating dedicated tables for different privacy levels
- **Think like a user** - what would they actually want to be public about their account?

Remember: **separation of concerns isn't just for code - it's for data privacy too!**

The fundamental principle here is respecting user privacy while still enabling the social features that make your application engaging. By thoughtfully separating what's private (authentication data) from what's public (profile information), you create a foundation that's both secure and user-friendly.
