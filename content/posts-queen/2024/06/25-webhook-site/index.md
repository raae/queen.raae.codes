When working on integrations sometimes you simply need to see exactly what is sent to the webhook. That's not always easy to know, especially if the webhook is triggered by a third-party service or even when received by a third-party service.

When working with the newly released Framer Forms I needed a quick way to check exactly what was sent to the webhook and remembered a tool I've used before: [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/).

Writing it down to hopefully remember this possibility faster the next time I need it. And maybe it can help you too!
