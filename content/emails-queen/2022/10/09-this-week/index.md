This week [Cam Sloan](https://twitter.com/SloanCam) climbs onboard, and we'll use his product [Hopscotch](https://hopscotch.club/) to add a product tour to [Prune your follows](https://prune.raae.tech/). I think this will be a fun one!

Lillian and I had an action-packed week of family fun in Heidelberg last week. But I also got some grown-up time with [Mirjam](https://twitter.com/mirjam_diala), who you might know from our [Conference Buddy](https://www.conferencebuddy.io/) streams last Christmas. Check out the [playlist on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9W-8hhRoLoNpEj71YsWChzOAocHiGZB4). We forgot to take a picture, so did it really happen?!

Ola, on the other hand, went sailing again ‚õµÔ∏è

Also, Gatsby released [v4.24](https://gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.24) at the end of September.
