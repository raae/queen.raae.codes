It's winter break time here in Oslo, Norway ⛷ The Pirate Princess and I are leaving for a cabin powered by solar energy tomorrow skipping the emails/stream this week 👑

Cap'n Ola will stay put and keep the ship afloat while we are gone!

I use node-canvas to draw social images for these emails. It was my first foray into node-canvas, and I am very much looking forward to catching up with this week's [Learn with Jason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/simplify-and-unify-data-access-with-netlify-graph) to learn even more from [Ulf Schwekendiek](https://twitter.com/sulf).
