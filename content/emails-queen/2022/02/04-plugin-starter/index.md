title: Create your own Gatsby plugin with automated releases
emojii: 📦 🪄

In yesterday's unauthorized and rum-fueled [treasure hunt](https://youtu.be/eaZm9MC0GeE) in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, we tested the Gatsby Plugin Starter I have been working on.

Good thing we did, because in revamping the example plugin that comes with the starter, I had introduced a bug 🤦‍♀️ Watch me figure it out [live on the stream](https://youtu.be/eaZm9MC0GeE?t=2322) 🤪

It was an easy enough fix, and [@raae/gatsby-plugin-starter](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-starter) is ready to be taken for a spin 🎉

## Why use the starter?

[The starter](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-starter) is a yarn workspace with both the plugin and a demo site configured for you. It makes it super fast to get started.

But even more excitedly, it comes with [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) configured to release new versions of your plugin to npm based on your commit messages!

If automation does not make you all excited, you can [borrow some of mine](https://youtu.be/eaZm9MC0GeE?t=4124) 🤪
