Netlify did not only release support for Gatsby SSG and DSG last week they also released [Scheduled Functions in beta](https://www.netlify.com/blog/quirrel-joins-netlify-and-scheduled-functions-launches-in-beta):

_Scheduled Functions is a feature of Netlify Functions that enables you to run functions on a regular and consistent schedule, much like a cron job._

There is also an [ongoing Netlify + Hashnode hackaton](https://townhall.hashnode.com/netlify-hackathon) happening with a $2000 USD cash prize.

The image library Sharp shipped [Resize, crop, and output animated GIFs](https://twitter.com/lovell/status/1488627570459426816?s=20&t=OsydhWJN72xl0lIlfnweag) support. Sharp is the library that powers Gatsby's image handling, so hopefully, gifs will be picked up by gatsby-transformer-sharp sometime soon!

GitHub released [Sponsored Repos](https://github.blog/2022-02-02-new-sponsors-only-repositories-custom-amounts-and-more/). If you would like similar functionality without GitHub sponsors, check out my winning [FuncJam](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-funcjam-21) entry: Selling access to a private Github repo with Stripe.

Gatsby is working on fixing the [trainling slash qunondrum](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/34205).
