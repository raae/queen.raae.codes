A new [Gatsby version 3.7](https://twitter.com/GatsbyChangelog/status/1491110567247237121?s=20&t=D6o_JaeU7gk4VFevxFR9zA) came out last week giving us a new config for trailing slash behavior. It seems like minor versions are coming bi-weekly these days!

On Tuesday, I plan to watch [Simplify & Unify Data Access With Netlify Graph](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/simplify-and-unify-data-access-with-netlify-graph) on Learn with Jason:

> With the new Netlify Graph product, you can read, write, & even subscribe to data from third-party APIs securely — without having to manage auth tokens or complex data fetching logic. Sean Grove teaches us how!

Lauren Etheridge of Sanity.io visit to [Content Strategy Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/Content-Strategy-Seattle/events/283654504/) looks interesting if you a European night owls or in a more convenient timezone.
