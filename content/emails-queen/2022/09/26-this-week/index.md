emojii: 🏝 🗓

Are you ready for some 🍕🍕🍕?

Thursday [Josh Johnson](https://twitter.com/0xJ05H) from Gatsby climbs onboard our unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, where we'll get to play around with the Slices API.

Next week the Pirate Princess and I are headed for Germany for the fall holidays. So no stream, emails, nor podcast. But I'll get to meet my [Slow & Steady Podcast](https://www.slowandsteadypodcast.com/) co-host for the first time IRL 🥳
