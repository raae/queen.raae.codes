This week the pirate princess and I are coming to London 🇬🇧

We would love to meet you!  
Reply to this email, and I'll send you the details for the informal piratical get-together on Wednesday at around 17:00 CET.

It's also the week of [Strapi Conf](https://conf.strapi.io/). One day of talks on Wednesday, March 16th, and a day of workshops on Thursday, March 17th. Strapi is one of the modern Headless CMSs.

The GatsbyConf talks are up on YouTube!  
Let me know if you make use of the new YT clips feature, and I'll make a round-up of the best clips 🎞
