title: How to make the MUI Component Library your own

For the app side of POW! ([my.usepow.app](https://my.usepow.app/login/)) I choose the [MUI Component Library](https://mui.com/).

I am not ecstatic about the choice, but it gets the job done! And MUI really shines for more utilitarian use cases.

My focus this spring is split between:

- Improving POW! for our users
- Helping you get the most out of Gatsby

So to free up a lot of head-space, we are standardizing on MUI across the board.

This week queen.raae.codes got the MUI treatment, and as you can see, it does not look very Material UI-y...

A big player in that is disabling "elevation" almost everywhere!

You can do it on a one-off basis:

```js
// On a per use basis
<Button disableElevation />
```

But that gets annoying fast, and I like to make it a global thing:

```js
// Globally

createTheme({
  components: {
    MuiButton: {
      defaultProps: {
        disableElevation: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The last approach is also suitable for making more considerable stylistic changes to the default components.

Let's see how I changed the list component for queen.raae.codes:

```js
createTheme({
  MuiListItemText: {
    defaultProps: {
      // Change both the primary and secondary text
      secondaryTypographyProps: {
        variant: "overline",
        gutterBottom: true,
      },
      primaryTypographyProps: {
        variant: "h5",
        gutterBottom: true,
      },
    },
    styleOverrides: {
      // Move the secondary text to the top
      root: {
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "column-reverse",
      },
    },
  },
  MuiListItemButton: {
    styleOverrides: {
      // Add underline to emphasis it's a link
      root: {
        ".MuiListItemText-primary": {
          textDecoration: "underline",
          "&:hover": {
            textDecoration: "none",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```
