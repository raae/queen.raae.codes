The dust is settling after a well blåst GatsbyConf 🎉

Since many talks were well past my bedtime, I am looking forward to catching up with the recordings that should be coming to the [Gatsby YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Gatsbyjs) this week.

In short, GatsbyConf gave us:

- Image CDN (Public Beta)
- Incremental Deploys (Public Beta)
- CMS Homepage Starters
- TypeScript Support
- On-Premises GitHub
- Private IP Addresses
- Geo and Language-Based Redirects
- Reverse Proxy
- Trailing Slashes

Also, [Gatsby v4.9](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.9/) was released giving us:
