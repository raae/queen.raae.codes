Short tip from today's coding session where I needed to make sure all Gatsby related packages were up to date:

```sh
yarn upgrade --pattern gatsby --latest
```

It will upgrade all packages with gatsby in its name to the latest version. Check out the [yarn upgrade docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/upgrade/) for more options.
