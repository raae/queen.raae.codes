I am staying in Oslo this week, but next week I'll be in NY and Minneapolis&nbsp;🇺🇸 I would love to meet you, so let me know if you are close to any of these cities.

Gatsby is back with a webinar with non other than our friend Arisa of Storyblok [all about localization](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/resources/webinars/high-performance-localization-storyblok/) 🥳

We also heard rumors there will be a new release this week, fixing the aspect ratio bug we hit while cropping YouTube Thumbnails in last week's [unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt](https://youtu.be/IDW2IfaHGIs).
