It's International Women's Day and not so coincidentally also POW!'s second birthday!

You might be wondering:

## What is POW?

POW! is the the privacy-first menstrual cycle journal I created as a proof of concept when working on the talk [A privacy first period tracker? Is it even possible?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS36D2zUkvA)

## Why is it relevant?

POW! is built with Gatsby. The code so far is [open source](https://github.com/raae/pow-app), and we'll be working on migrating the marketing site (currently on Squarespace ðŸ˜³) [to Gatsby](https://github.com/olavea/pow-site) â€” I see interesting POW! themed Gatsby Deep-Dives in our future....

## How can I help?

We need folks willing to be interviewed about their current cycle logging habits. If that is you, or someone you know, send an email to hello@usepow.app or DM me on Twitter [@raae](https://twitter.com/raae).

All the best,  
Queen Raae

**PS:** Cap'n Ola's birthday present to POW! is a new crew member. Read all about it on [olavea.com](https://www.olavea.com/pow/).
