Are you swamped in customer requests for how to integrate your SaaS with Gatsby, Next, or even plain React?

We can now help!

Imagine having a fully working integration demo done for you, created by experts in these exact frameworks.

Complete with a code repository on GitHub/CodeSandbox, and an engaging video walkthrough!

But don't take my word for it:

> I hired Queen Raae to help my start-up with a really important project: demonstrating how our software can be integrated with a React application.
>
> This was a highly technical project that **required a seasoned software engineer** to execute — and teach — well. She executed the project with very little oversight, taking the requirements and delivering solid solutions through her own trial, error, and understanding of our SDK.
>
> It allowed us to deliver an important project that will **benefit our customers for a long time to come**, cost-effectively and without pulling our engineers away from their other work.
