Next week you'll get a break from my emails and the Thursday stream as it's the Easter holiday here in Norway 🐣

The plan is to break for all school holidays going forward.

But that does not mean nothing is happening around the Gatsby islands, but I am also not devastated by activity.

Gatsby is running a webinar, and we'll probably see them drop v4.12.

If you are interested in working at Gatsby, they are looking for a [Senior Software Engineer (Full-Stack)](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/careers/senior-software-engineer--full-stack--4910418003).

Pirate [Ineza](https://twitter.com/inezabonte) landed his first dev job a while back, and this week Scrimba released their interview all about the process. [Give it a listen](https://twitter.com/inezabonte/status/1512076196644737034?s=20&t=LIypA9gn8tgWZVWFk_cc2g) 🎧

## Our streaming schedule next week

🔴 🏴‍☠️ The unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunts around the Gatsby islands will be back Thursday, April 21st.
