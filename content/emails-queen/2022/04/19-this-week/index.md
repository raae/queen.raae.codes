It's not Monday, but I live in a long and "krokete" country, so the powers that be extended easter by one day way back when.

[![Since there were a lot of mountains in between these churches, the gov't added an extra day off so that the priests would have time enough to visit all villages 😅](./easter-monday.png)](https://twitter.com/selbekk/status/1515752274022342657)

I am so ready to get back into the comfortable routine of everyday life after my month of traveling!

This spring, I am planning to overhaul my first ever Gatsby project: [gatsby-remark-oembed](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-remark-oembed) — a plugin that transforms stand alone links into its oEmbed HTML counterpart.

Would you like to get involved?

Or maybe you have your own Gatsby-related Spring plans?  
Let me know, and I might share it with the list 🎁

Last week Gatsby released v4.12. Mostly bug fixes, but also two interesting RFC (Request for Comments):

- [RFC for new Script component in Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35404) - the script component will make it easier to incorporate 3rd party scripts without negatively impacting site performance
- [RFC for new Bundler in Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35357) - Gatsby is evaluating other bundlers in order to deliver faster local development and production build speeds

So if you have any options on that, jump in with a comment.
