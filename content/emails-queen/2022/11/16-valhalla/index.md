title: What is Gatsby Valhalla?

The other day on [Twitter Aremu posted a great question](https://twitter.com/aremu_smog/status/1592398568434069504):

> I still can't wrap my head around what @GatsbyJS Valhalla is. I get the part where it's supposed to unify multiple content sources but couldn't you do that with normal gatsby-node.js? Is it a GUI? Is it a concept/approach to work? an npm package?

In answer, I replied:

> It's what you see when you open the graphiql explorer, but as a stand alone product to be used by any framework.

I have not had time to play around with it yet. But I am very excited about what Valhalla might do for the plugin ecosystem. If they succeed, I hope it encourages CMS and other services to up their Gatsby source and transformer game.
