title: We broke Twitter (kind of) with our launch
---

Thank you, thank you, thank you üôè

We are in awe of all the support for [Prune your Follows](https://pruneyourfollows.com/), and I guess us ü•∞

The launch went so well that Twitter was not having it. After just a couple of hours, Prune your Follows had facilitated over 500 unfollows, and Twitter cut off our access üò±

Giving most users of Prune your Follows this experience:

Even so, we claimed the 13th spot on Product Hunt that day üí™

Some highlights:

- Having an annoyed user help rewrite the alert [to something positive](https://twitter.com/raae/status/1603492853585436706?s=20&t=aBPK5fBpomRgAqcmiZz26g)
- Aremu doing all he could on Twitter to help support us [including this meme](https://twitter.com/aremu_smog/status/1603312952597270528?s=20&t=aBPK5fBpomRgAqcmiZz26g)
- The 80+ comments on the [Product Hunt launch page](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/prune-your-follows)
- Several folks loving PYF and [asking for new features](https://twitter.com/raae/status/1603331684052733952?s=20&t=aBPK5fBpomRgAqcmiZz26g)
- 100+ new users on the day and another 100+ users over the weekend
