Let's say you want to embed a Tweet or add website analytics. How would you go about including the external third-party script required?

That was the topic for my first ever Live Screencasts ‚Äî concise, instructional videos on a single Gatsby topic.

- [Watch the Live Screeencast](https://youtu.be/Kldx6d5XBSE)

I have found three practical ways of doing so with Gatsby.

## 1. `onRenderBody`

An excellent solution for global scripts must be available on every page, such as website analytics.

With `onRenderBody`, the script is added when the site statically generates. The script tag is part of the initial HTML even before the site rehydrates.

```
import React from "react";

const headComponents = [
  <script
    key="fathom-script"
    src="https://cdn.usefathom.com/script.js"
    data-site="CNOZPPSE"
    defer
  ></script>,
];

export const onRenderBody = ({setHeadComponents}) => {
  setHeadComponents(headComponents);
};
```

## 2. React Helmet

Using React Helmet is another method for adding the script as part of the statically generated pages. However, it makes it easy to include the script only on certain pages.

- [Jump in to to see React Helmet in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kldx6d5XBSE&t=360s)

```
import React from "react";
import {Helmet} from "react-helmet";

const TweetPageReactHelmet = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <Helmet>
        <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" />
      </Helmet>

      <section>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
          {/* ... rest of tweet embed code */}
        </blockquote>{" "}
      </section>
    </main>
  );
};

export default TweetPageReactHelmet;
```

## 3. `document.createElement`

Suppose you want to have more control over when a script is loaded. In that case, you can do so by manipulating the DOM inside a `useEffect` (or `onClick` or another event that makes sense...).

- [Jump in to see `document.createElement` in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kldx6d5XBSE&t=619s)

```
import React, {useEffect} from "react";

const TweetPageCreateElement = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const script = document.createElement("script");
    script.src = "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";
    document.head.appendChild(script);
    return () => {
      script.remove();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <main>
      <section>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
          {/* ... rest of tweet embed code */}
        </blockquote>
      </section>
    </main>
  );
};

export default TweetPageCreateElement;
```

Have you used any of these?  
Do you know of another way?
