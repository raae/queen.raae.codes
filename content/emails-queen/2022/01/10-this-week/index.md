I had somehow convinced myself this is the week I turn 40, but alas its another year before I can join the rank of the older and wiser 🤪

This week there are two interesting webinars back to back on Thursday. One by Gatsby on [Peak Frontend Performance](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/resources/webinars/gatsby-peak-frontend-performance) and one on [Managing Remote State w/ React Query](https://cfe.dev/events/managing-remote-state-react/). The latter is not Gatsby specific, but Gatsby + React Query = a Nice Setup.

I'll have to watch them both after the fact, as Thursday is also the day for our unauthorized and rum-fueled [treasure hunt](https://youtu.be/D_03KW4AkSk) in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands.

Last week fellow [Blogging for Devs](https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/) member Philo Hermans released [Unlock](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/unlock-7). A product that should take all the pain out of selling software, including npm packages.

I think this could be a solution for those of us wanting to sell Gatsby Plugins...
