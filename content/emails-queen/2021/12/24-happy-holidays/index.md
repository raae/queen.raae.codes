No stream this week, but we've been busy making non the less:

- During stream time yesterday, we made Christmas bread,
- earlier in the week [a plethora of "nisser"](https://twitter.com/raae/status/1473407109480034311?s=20) showed up,
- and this morning I released [version 1.0.0](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-let-it-snow) of `Let it snow ❄️❄️❄️`

Seeing `Let it snow ❄️❄️❄️` in the wild brings me so much joy. Please let me know if you add it to your site over the holidays.

**God jul** from our little family(business) to yours!

All the best,

**PS:** We'll manage to squeeze in one more Thursday stream before the new year. Hope to see you in the chat [December 30th 19:00 CET](https://youtu.be/d834JE_bFog).
