title: Getting back in the (literal) saddle 🐎 And this week's schedule
brands: Xata

Spent the weekend at a horse farm with the Pirate Princess doing five classes each and plenty of chores. I don't know why I even brought my computer 🤷‍♀️

It's been a month since I fell off a horse and got a minor concussion. And it was fantastic to get back in the saddle. A little more conscious than I have been in the past, asked to focus on the basics. But I also did a few jumps 💪

What's your (metaphorical) saddle? Is there anything you've postponed because you fear getting back into it?

Tell me, and I'll be your accountability buddy!
