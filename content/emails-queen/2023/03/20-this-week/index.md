title: 1000+ Prune your Follows users 🥳 And this week's schedule
---

Spend the weekend at a mountain cabin catching up on some work, hanging with my friend, and skiing.

It was also the weekend Prune your Follows passed 1000 users 🥳 We'll celebrate by testing the new Xata AI feature to help you find more accounts to unfollow on [Thursday's unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt](https://www.youtube.com/live/PmbSFeDzg0U).

This week we'll interview [Pierre de Wulf](https://twitter.com/PierreDeWulf) for the [Xata podcast Data in the Wild](https://www.youtube.com/live/zGsPJz6Jjw8).
