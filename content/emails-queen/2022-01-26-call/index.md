Yesterday I made it possible to book 1-on-1 Emergency Gatsby Calls with me.

When you have Googled. Looked through Stack Overflow. Tried to get help in the Gatsby Discord. But you are still stuck on a reef in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, ready to give up! To abandon the ship! It's time to [book a call](https://queen.raae.codes/gatsby-emergency/).

## Sharing is caring

And remember, next time you come across a Gatsby Captain stuck on a reef, let them know I can get them unstuck and help make sure they stay clear of the reef the next time around. Send them to queen.raae.codes/gatsby-emergency.

All the best,

**PS:** I would love to get some feedback on the page. Does it make sense? Is something missing or lacking? Let me know!
