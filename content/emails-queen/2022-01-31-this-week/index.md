title: This week around the Gatsby islands — New
emojii: 🏝 🗓
---

It's the week of [TheJam.dev 2022](https://cfe.dev/events/the-jam-2022/). A free conference on all things Jamstack. Abhi Aiyer of Gatsby will do a session on [Gatsby is Evolving](https://cfe.dev/sessions/jamdev2022-gatsby-evolving/).

Last week Gatsby announced their keynote speaker for Gatsby Conf. It seems they are [mighty proud](https://twitter.com/GatsbyJS/status/1484252400965853185?s=20) of getting Chris Coyer on board, as they should be.

If you'd like to understand React hooks better, check out [Mastering React Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjTN6yHoWYI&list=PLqcl38GHd4J9aJ1cAngJ3CoGyTnjL1x7i) by React Roundup co-host Paige Niedringhaus. Getting better at React makes it easier to get the most out of Gatsby.

And last but not least, the Pirate Princess turns seven this week 🥳
