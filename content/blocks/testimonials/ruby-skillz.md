I wish I could turn back the clock and get these weekly motivation reminders when I first started my frontend skill building - it would have saved me hours in the suck zone. I always thought I could FORCE myself to do frontend skill building - but I hit a wall and realized I needed help to get to next level of my own motivation game.
