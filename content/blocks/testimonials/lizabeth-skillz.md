I'd be in prison in The Tower of London if it wasn't for Ruby's frontend skill building. And you dear reader probably wouldn't have for example William Shakespear's plays. Where would Shakespear's plays have been without my years of golden rule and the following Golden Age of Pirates? Gone if Mary 1 had won. Don't thank me, thank my half sister Ruby Reckless.
