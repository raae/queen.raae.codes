## My Sunday Skill Builder Session:
This Sunday I was only supposed to prepare 1 node and get data later. What went wrong?

## What did I do?
I prepared 1 node.

## Why did I do it?
I did just a tiiiny task, again. So that I automate it in my brain. (That ryhmes, if I ay so myself. 💪😺)

## How did I do it (WRONG)?
I just kept coding further. For 2 more hours! Live on youtube.

💪😺👍

Keep your skill-builder-ship afloat this week!
