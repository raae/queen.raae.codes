## Stuck on a reef in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands?

You have Googled. You have looked through Stack Overflow. You have tried to get help in the Gatsby Discord. But you are stuck on that reef. You are ready to give up! To abandon the ship!

## Imagine getting the help you need

Imagine this – Imagine getting pulled off the reef without damage. Imagine your Gatsby navigation skills improving. Imagine having the confidence that you'll stay clear of the reef the next time around.

## Speak with a seasoned Gatsby developer

Get Unstuck – Often, all it takes to get unstuck is to talk to the right person at the right time. A person who has experience sailing around the Gatsby waters and probably has experience with that same reef, or at least a very similar reef.

### Why me?

- I have worked on Gatsby projects since 2018.
- I enjoy figuring out how to get the most out of the frameworks I use.
- I have been coding since 1995 and have been stuck on my fair share of reefs by now.
- I was chosen by Gatsby as a speaker for Gatsby Days 2020 and Gatsby Fall Camp 2021
- I am the winner of the Gatsby FuncJam 2021
- I have created apps trusted by the Swedish Armed Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and others.

### Here's How It Works

You book an Emergency Gatsby Call with me using my private scheduling link. The event is 60 minutes, but you might want to block out extra time in case we go a little long. Our call will take place over Whereby. When booking, I'll ask you to give me a quick rundown of your troubles and your tech stack.

### 100% Money back guarantee

If I cannot help you find a way to get off your reef, I'll refund your payment in full.

### Availability is limited

I'm only available for a couple live emergency calls per week. Scheduling is first-come, first-served, so the sooner you book your call, the sooner you'll get off the reef.
