## Would you like to add a tip jar to your site? Accept donations? Or sell a digital something?

Watch me blast through selling time travels for 1000 USD a pop in 15 minutes at Gasby Fall Camp&nbsp;'21&nbsp;🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️

If you would like to learn how to create a pay-what-you-want feature at a slower pace, with live support and group accountability — join the boot camp, and I'll **guarantee** you'll have your **pay-what-you-want feature deployed** by the end of the week 💪

## What you'll build

**A TimeShip**

I'll provide you with TimeShip starter files, and you'll add the needed pay-what-you-want functionality, including fulfilling the travel by sending out a fun pdf through SendGrid.

Or in less creative terms:

- a Gatsby Function that creates a Stripe Checkout Session
- a Gatsby Function used as a webhook by Stripe to fulfill the order
- a Gatsby Function to fetch a Stripe Checkout Session

If you are not into time-traveling, make the project your own or add similar functionality to your own existing Gatsby site.

## What you'll learn?

- How to approach the project and split it into **manageable tasks**
- The **structure** of a typical Serverless function
- How to **handle secrets** both in development and production environments
- The joys of **data validation** and **error handling**!
- How to **deploy** to Netlify or Gatsby Cloud
- What **webhooks** are and how to make them using Gatsby Functions
- How to create **Stripe Checkout Sessions** server-side to support **pay-what-you-want** and add metadata used in fulfillment.

## What's included?

The Mini Bootcamp Command Central is a private GitHub repo you'll get access to, and keep access to until the end of the year (at least).

### Forum

_24/7 access_

The Discussions tab of the private GitHub repo will be our forum. There you may ask questions, discuss possible solutions and get to know the other current (and former) students.

### Assignment + Starter Files

_Saturday 10:00 CEST_

We’ll start the week with a couple of days for you to try your hands at coming up with a solution on our assignment on your own, I promise it will make the live webinar so much more valuable!

### Live Webinar

_Tuesday 20:00 CEST / 11:00 PST - 1.5 hour_

See how a Gatsby Function is made from start to finish in the live webinar where I code through a complete example solution to our assignment. The recording will be made available.

### Co-working session

_Wednesday 10:00 CEST - 3 hours_

Highly optional, but if you need some accountability, we'll be there to make sure you stay on task. We check in with each other 3 times but mostly work silently (virtually) side-by-side.

### Code Sample

_Thursday 10:00 CEST_

The live webinar code will be available as a Pull Request in the private GitHub repo. Feel free to comment and ask questions directly on the Pull Request.

### Celebratory Q&A Session

_Saturday 20:00 CEST / 11:00 PST - 1 hour_

Bring your questions, code, and or celebratory beverage to this live Q&A session.

## Who am I?

I have been having fun on the web with code since the late '90s.

The person who first introduced me to HTML was my Norwegian teacher, and since then:

- I have completed a Master in Computer Science
- Built apps trusted by the Swedish Armed Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and others.
- Created POW! — the encrypted menstrual cycle journal made with Gatsby and many other skill-building side projects.
- Spoken at both Gatsby Days and Gatsby Camp, in addition to RuhrJS, JSConf Budapest, and more.

Last but not least, I started live-streaming my coding resulting in the weekly YouTube show Gatsby Deep Dives with Queen Raae and the Nattermob Pirates.

Sleek and "professional" I am not. My thing is informal, energetic, and fun. Failing code is part of the process, and together we figure out how to fix it. No need to conform to any ideas of how a coder should be or act; come as you are!
