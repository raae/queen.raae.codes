I had never worked with serverless before, I assumed it was a topic that was way out of my league ðŸ˜…. But you proved me wrong!

One aspect that I liked was **the live sessions** we had on crowdcast. I got the opportunity to **ask questions** and watch you code an application step by step.

I would definitely recommend your bootcamps to others because this is a great opportunity to learn about emerging technologies and also **connect with amazing people**.
