## ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of backend in your life ðŸŽ¶

You are a front-end developer, you would like to take some tiny steps towards full-stack. But where to start? You heard Serverless is a good place to start, but last time you tried you couldn't get passed configuration h\*ll or the `hello world` example.

## ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of Serverless on your side ðŸŽ¶

Imagine being able to effortlessly develop and deploy Serverless functionality when needed. Knowing how to handle secrets on the server and integrating with _all the thing_ utilizing their APIs, not needing to call for help to complete backend functionality.

## ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of Gatsby is all you need ðŸŽ¶

Newly released Gatsby Functions radically simplifies how to write and deploy Aerverless functions. It removes the need for complicated configuration, letting you focus on developing and deploying the functionality you need. A student of our 5 week summer program replaced a paid product with a single function in his first week ðŸ¤¯

## What you'll make?

A TimeShip!

One intended to find Pirate Princess Lillian aged 11 so she can help break Lizabeth out of jail back in London, year 1554.

Or in less interesting terms, a Gatsby Serverless Function that takes data from a form and pushes it to a third party service + a Gatsby Serverless Function that then fetches that data, displays it on your page and updates so new data automagically appears.

If you are not into time travelling, make the project your own or add similar functionality to your own existing Gatsby site.

## What you'll learn?

- How to approach your idea and split it into manageable tasks
- The structure of a good Serverless function
- The joys of data validation and error handling!
- Calling/polling/requesting a Serverless function from your site
- How to deploy to Netlify or Gatsby Cloud

## What's included?

The Mini Bootcamp Command Central is a private GitHub repo you'll get access to, and keep access to until the end of the year (at least).

### Forum

_24/7 access_

The Discussions tab of the private GitHub repo will be our forum. There you may ask questions, discuss possible solutions and get to know the other current (and former) students.

### Assignment + Starter Files

_Saturday 10:00 CEST_

Weâ€™ll start the week with a couple of days for you to try your hands at coming up with a solution on our assignment on your own, I promise it will make the live webinar so much more valuable!

### Live Webinar

_Tuesday 20:00 CEST / 11:00 PST - 1.5 hour_

See how a Gatsby Function is made from start to finish in the live webinar where I code trough a full example solution to our assignment. Recording will be made available.

### Co-working session

_Wednesday 10:00 CEST - 3 hours_

Highly optional, but if you need some accountability weâ€™ll be there to make sure you stay on task. We check in with each other 3 times, but mostly work silently (virtually) side-by-side.

### Code Sample

_Thursday 10:00 CEST_

The live webinar code will be available as a Pull Request in the private GitHub repo. Feel free to comment and ask questions directly on the Pull Request.

### Celebratory Q&A Session

_Saturday 20:00 CEST / 11:00 PST - 1 hour_

Bring your questions, code and or celebratory beverage to this live Q&A session.

## Who am I?

I have been having fun on the web with code since the late '90s.

The person who first introduced me to HTML was my Norwegian teacher, and since then:

I have completed a Master in Computer Science; built apps trusted by the Swedish Armed Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and others.
Created POW! â€” the encrypted menstrual cycle journal made with Gatsby and many other skill-building side projects.
Spoken at both Gatsby Days and Gatsby Camp, in addition to RuhrJS, JSConf Budapest, and more.

Last but not least, I started live-streaming my coding resulting in the weekly YouTube show Gatsby Deep Dives with Queen Raae and the Nattermob Pirates.

Sleek and "professional" I am not. My thing is informal, energetic, and fun. Failing code is part of the process, and together we figure out how to fix it. No need to conform to any ideas of how a coder should be or act; come as you are!
