## ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of backend in your life ðŸŽ¶

You can code up front-ends all day long. But when it comes to the backend, you don't know where to start. You are not even sure you have the skills for it... You've heard folks on the Interwebz lamenting on how much hard core backend coding is, and lets not get started on figuring out how to set up AWS to get started with Serverless.

## ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of Serverless on your side ðŸŽ¶

Imagine being able to effortlessly develop and deploy Serverless functionality when needed. Knowing how to handle secrets on the server and integrating with all the services utilizing their APIs.

## ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of Gatsby is all you need ðŸŽ¶

Gatsby removes the need for complicated configuration, letting you focus on developing and deploying the functionality you need. And the group and I will be there every step of the way, helping you get all the way to deploy.
