## Learn to develop and deploy backend functionality that handles secret tokens and communications with a third-party service.

ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of backend in your life

You can code up front-ends all day long. But when it comes to the backend, you don't know where to start. You think maybe Serverless is the way to go, but you've heard it's super complicated to set up. Afraid of getting stuck in configuration h\*ll and not knowing what to make, you never start!

ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of Serverless on your side

Imagine being able to effortlessly develop and deploy Serverless functionality when needed. Knowing how to handle secrets on the server and integrating with all the services utilizing their APIs.

ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of Gatsby is all you need

Gatsby removes the need for complicated configuration, letting you focus on developing and deploying the functionality you need. And the group and I will be there every step of the way, helping you get all the way to deploy.
