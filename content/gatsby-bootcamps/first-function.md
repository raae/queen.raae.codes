      testimonial: I'd be in prison in The Tower of London if it wasn't for Ruby's frontend skill building. And you dear reader probably wouldn't have for example William Shakespear's plays. Where would Shakespear's plays have been without my years of golden rule and the following Golden Age of Pirates? Gone if Mary 1 had won. Don't thank me, thank my half sister Ruby Reckless.

      testimonial: I wish I could turn back the clock and get these weekly motivation reminders when I first started my frontend skill building - it would have saved me hours in the suck zone. I always thought I could FORCE myself to do frontend skill building - but I hit a wall and realized I needed help to get to next level of my own motivation game.

      testimonial: Ruby is a wonderful opponent. She goes out of her way to make my life interesting and will challenge me and do the things that â€“ though I might not always want them done to me â€“ are crucial to keeping me motivated to build my skills as a scary super spy.

## ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of backend in your life ðŸŽ¶

You can code up front-ends all day long. But when it comes to the backend, you don't know where to start. You are not even sure you have the skills for it... You've heard folks on the Interwebz lamenting on how much hard core backend coding is, and lets not get started on figuring out how to set up AWS to get started with Serverless.

## ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of Serverless on your side ðŸŽ¶

Imagine being able to effortlessly develop and deploy Serverless functionality when needed. Knowing how to handle secrets on the server and integrating with all the services utilizing their APIs.

## ðŸŽ¶ A little bit of Gatsby is all you need ðŸŽ¶

Gatsby removes the need for complicated configuration, letting you focus on developing and deploying the functionality you need. And the group and I will be there every step of the way, helping you get all the way to deploy.
