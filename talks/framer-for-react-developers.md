## Title

Crash Course in Framer for React Developers

## Talk Description (3 - 7 sentences, will be used for talk description on website)

Framer isn't just a powerful design tool for designers—it’s built on React, allowing you to add functionality with the React skills you already know. In this talk, you’ll get a crash course in custom components, code overrides, and plugins. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to extend Framer sites with custom functionality.

## Talk Overview (Rough outline of your talk including key points and take aways that are beneficial to React developers)

Framer is shippign like crazy so the talk might end up a bit different from what's outlined here.

- Introduction to Framer
- Why Framer is especially interesting for React developers - it's React based
- Add functionality to a Framer component with code overrides - ie. Higher Order Components for us Rect Devs
- Add functionality with custom Framer components - ie. straigh up component for us Rect Devs
- Pull custom content into the Framer CMS with a Framer CMS Plugin built with React
- Improve the editor experience with a Framer Canvas Plugin built with React
- Summary of the talk

I'll use my Framer work at Outseta as the basis for the demos/examples in the talk to make it more than a theoritical exploration.
