        <p>If you're building code components or code overrides for <a href="https://framer.link/queen-raae">Framer</a>, you'll want to handle three different render modes: canvas, preview, and live.</p>

<p><strong>Canvas</strong> — The Framer editor. Your component is rendered as a static preview while designing.</p>

<p><strong>Preview</strong> — Preview mode. Interactive, but still in the Framer environment.</p>

<p><strong>Live</strong> — The published site where custom code such as the Outseta script executes.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly (at least to me 😆), Framer's <code>RenderTarget</code> returns "preview" for both preview and live as I've defined them. This makes sense for design, but not for more app-like functionality as I've found out while building <a href="https://outseta.com/?via=queen">Outseta</a> code overrides and components that depend on the execution of custom code.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>After some trial and error, I found the most robust way to distinguish between preview and live is to check the hostname. If it includes "framercanvas.com", it's preview, otherwise it's live.</p>

<p>Live is intentionally the fallback mode, so if Framer changes the preview hostname the component will still work as expected in the more crucial live mode.</p>

<pre><code class="language-tsx">import { RenderTarget } from "framer";

type RenderMode = "canvas" | "preview" | "live";

function getRenderMode(): RenderMode {
  const renderTarget = RenderTarget.current();

  if (renderTarget === RenderTarget.canvas) {
    return "canvas";
  } else if (renderTarget === RenderTarget.preview &amp;&amp; window?.location.host.includes("framercanvas.com")) {
    return "preview";
  } else {
    return "live";
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Why not do feature checks instead?</h2>

<p>This is a valid approach — we could check for the presence of the Outseta script and only continue with Outseta logic if present:</p>

<pre><code class="language-tsx">if (typeof Outseta !== "undefined") {
  // Outseta is available, do the thing
}
</code></pre>

<p>This handles the error, but it doesn't give you control over the designer experience. With feature checks alone we're not asking "what experience should I provide for this mode?"</p>

<p>With explicit mode handling you can, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add props like <code>showOnPreview</code> to force a specific state, letting designers preview logged-in views without having to publish</li>
<li>Write to the console in live mode when the Outseta script is missing and remove the component — but in preview mode a missing script is expected, so no need to clutter the console with warnings</li>
<li>Skip analytics events in canvas and preview — only fire them in live mode</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Framer code runs in three modes:</strong> canvas, preview, and live — each needs different behavior</li>
<li><strong>External scripts only run in live mode</strong> — your code needs fallbacks for canvas and preview</li>
<li><strong>Live as fallback is intentional</strong> — if Framer changes their preview hostname, your published site still works</li>
<li><strong>Mode checks > feature checks</strong> — they give you control over the designer experience, not just error avoidance</li>
</ul>

<p>What is your approach to handling render modes in Framer? Are there edge cases I haven't covered? I'd love to hear about it.</p>

<p>Happy building! 🛠️</p>
