        <p>Semantic HTML Elements are a foundational piece of the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>However, the popularity <a href="https://queen.raae.codes/2022-10-10-semantic-react/">A little semantic HTML trick for React components</a> and doing Gatsby code reviews have shown me that this is a topic that many developers need to brush up on.</p>

<p>Myself included!</p>

<p>There are quite a few new (and some deprecated) elements since the last time I did any intentional research on the topic.</p>

<p>So, this advent, I will share byte-sized emails on a new Semantic HTML Element each day in December until Christmas. The first element out is <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>. Read it over on <a href="https://advent.raae.codes/2023-12-01-fieldset/">advent.raae.codes</a>, and be sure to sign up for the next ones.</p>

<p><strong>Inspired?</strong></p>

<p>Join in and take responsibility for one of the days 🙏\
Reply, and I'll share the details on how to contribute with you.</p>

<p>All the best,\
Queen Raae</p>
