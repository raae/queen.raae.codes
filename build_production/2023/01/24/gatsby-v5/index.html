        <p>As soon as v5 was released, I tried upgrading but quickly put it on the shelf as I use <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas"><code>node-canvas</code></a> to draw the open graph images. And back in November, <code>node-canvas</code> did not have Node v18 support!</p>

<p>But now it does, and the upgrade was pretty swift for me 🥳</p>

<p>I ran the <code>gatsby-codemods</code> to fix <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/#graphql-schema-changes-to-sort-and-aggregation-fields">GraphQL schema: Changes to sort and aggregation fields</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">npx gatsby-codemods@latest sort-and-aggr-graphql .
</code></pre>

<p>Then I also had to refactor from <code>nodeModel.runQuery</code> to <code>nodeModel.getAllNodes</code> in my "find related content" resolver inspired by <a href="https://reckoning.dev/blog/related-posts-gatsbyjs/">How to Create List of Related Content in Gatsby.JS</a>.</p>

<p>All the best,\
