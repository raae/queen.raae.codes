        <p>Yes, in roughly equal amounts. But of course, without a Product Hunt, there would probably not have been a Tech Crunch article.</p>

<p><a href="https://pruneyourfollows.com/">Prune your Follows</a> came in as the 13th product of the day, showing that even when missing the elusive top 10, a Product Hunt launch can still have an add-on effect.</p>

<p>Things change a little by looking at the traffic directly from the two sources. Product Hunt does not have much of a long tale, but it seems Tech Crunch might.</p>

<p>🤦‍♀️ We do not track the signup dates, so I cannot give you a pretty graph of the signups. However, I followed the numbers of users in the database pretty closely during both events, and the traffic peaks corresponded to a spike in new users.</p>

<p><strong>Note to self for next time:</strong> Either make sure to track signup dates or, better yet, use a tool like <a href="https://logsnag.com/">LogSnag</a>, and I'd have a pretty graph to show out of the box.</p>

<p>Current status:</p>

<ul>
<li>820 users</li>
<li>13.767 unfollows facilitated</li>
<li>308 emails collected</li>
</ul>

<p>All the best,\
