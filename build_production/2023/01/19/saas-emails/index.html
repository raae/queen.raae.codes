        <p>"What do I email my SaaS users?" is a question you should probably be asking a little earlier in your journey than I did. No email has yet been sent to Prune your Follows users 😬</p>

<p>You could probably ask ChatGPT, but I am getting "at capacity" messages right now. Also, I still believe in a little human touch.</p>

<p>But if you, like me, still need some help getting started with your SaaS lifecycle emails, check out Userlist's <a href="https://userlist.com/docs/campaign-templates/">Full-Text Campaign Templates</a>.</p>

<p>No more staring at a blank ~piece of paper~ screen 💪</p>

<p>They got templates for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Onboarding</li>
<li>Upgrade to Paid</li>
<li>Newly Upgraded</li>
<li>Switch to Annual Billing</li>
<li>Ask for a Review</li>
<li>Offer Support Proactively</li>
<li>NPS Survey</li>
<li>Upcoming Payment</li>
<li>Failed Payment Recovery</li>
<li>Cancellation Survey</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://userlist.com/docs/campaign-templates/"><img src="./templates.png" alt="Screenshot of list of templates + start of &quot;Basic Onboarding&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>I'll use the "Basic Onboarding" and "Ask for a Review" myself in the coming weeks as we set up campaigns for Prune your Follows.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the best,\
Queen Raae</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Co-founder of Userlist Benedikt is my Slow&amp;Steady co-host and is sponsoring Prune your Follows with an account. But I have been recommending these templates for a long time with great feedback.</p>
