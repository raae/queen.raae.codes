        <p>Even after streaming, podcasting and writing almost daily, I have not seen myself as a "content creator." But I guess that is part of who I am, maybe even a large part and truth be told, a part of my day-to-day I find exciting, creative and fun 🎉</p>

<p>The new year even started with closing a deal to produce three videos for Xata. So I guess it's time to embrace it and make 2023 the year I come out as a content creator. It might not come as a surprise to you, though 🤷‍♀️</p>

<p>We'll keep leaning into audio and video, so let me know if your company could benefit from some joyful videos or a podcast season tailored to your dev audience!</p>
