        <p>I naively thought all we needed for NextAuth to work with a Xata Worker was getting access to the <code>NEXTAUTH_SECRET</code> env variable.</p>

<p>But alas, when moving to a Xata Worker, the cookie set by NextAuth is unavailable as the Worker is served from another domain. However, the <code>getToken</code> function can also get the token from the `Authorization: 'Bearer token'. But how do we make that happen 🤷‍♀️</p>

<p>We'll figure it out over the next few weeks! I am sure 💪</p>

<p>If you have any experience with Cloudflare Workers (Xata Workers are an abstraction on top of Cloudflare Workers) and NextAuth, please reach out 🙏</p>
