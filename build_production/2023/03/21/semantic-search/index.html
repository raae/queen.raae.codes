        <p>This weekend I explored Semantic Search using OpenAI and Vector Search from Xata to see if it could be something for Prune your Follows.</p>

<p>To understand the difference better, I created a demo comparing it to the other two search options Xata provides: full-text search with fuzzy matching and partial plaintext search using "contains".</p>

<p>Searching for "norway" all three gives us results for accounts mentioning "norway" in some way:</p>

<p><img src="./norway.png" alt="A search for &quot;norway&quot; gives results for all three types of search" /></p>

<p>However, when searching for "norwegians" we can see where Semantic Search shines. @nynorskdama does not mention "norwegian" or "norway", but semantically "norsk" is the same as "norwegian" in Norwegian 🤯</p>

<p><img src="./norwegians.png" alt="A search for &quot;norwegians&quot; gives results for all but plaintext type of search" /></p>

<p>It might also know that "Ulsteinvik" is geography part of Norway and thus semantically close to "norwegians" as is the case when searching for "valdres" - a location in Norway and it gives us accounts located other places in Norway:</p>

<p><img src="./valdres.png" alt="A search for &quot;valdres&quot; gives results only for semantic stype of search" /></p>

<p>For a great rundown of how to get started and the article I used to kick start my journey, check out <a href="https://twitter.com/Swizec">Swizec</a>'s <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/build-semantic-search-in-an-afternoon-yep/">Build semantic search in an afternoon? Yep 🤯</a> even if it took me longer than an afternoon 😬</p>

<p>The next step is to use what I have learned to explore <a href="/2023-03-25-similar-accounts">a similar accounts feature</a> for Prune your Follows on this week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/PmbSFeDzg0U">unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt</a>.</p>
