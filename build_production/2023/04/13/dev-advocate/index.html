        <p>You might have seen it from a mile away, but it took me a long time to embrace, accept, lean into, or whatever it was, that my ideal role in this industry is as a Developer Advocate 🥑</p>

<p>And just as I did, the opportunity of a lifetime came along. I am joining <a href="http://www.outseta.com?via=queen">Outseta</a>, the all-in-one membership software, as a fractional Developer Advocate.</p>

<p>I'll be earning a salary and equity per Outseta's <a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/payment-structure">unique approach to compensation and ownership</a>.</p>

<p>Have you not always been in Developer Relations? You might ask.</p>

<p>Many folks assumed I worked for Gatsby in some Developer Relations capacity. I did not 😆</p>

<p>But we created Prune your Follows in public in partnership with Xata and are now producing a podcast for them. So you could say it's been written in the stars for a few months now, and accepting the position unlocked this memory for me:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/raae/status/1646417559967629313"><img src="./tweet_memory.png" alt="September 2018, I finished the sentence: &quot;In five years I'll be&quot; with &quot;a Developer Advocate&quot; for my uni reunion. Then life, side projects, and becoming a Gatsby authority happened. But here we are four and a half years later, and I am Outseta's fractional Developer Advocate 🎉" /></a></p>

<p>So while it hasn't felt intentional, who knows how these things fall into place 🤷‍♀️</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the best,\
Queen Raae</p>
