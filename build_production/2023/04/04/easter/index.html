        <p>I'm a conflicted Norwegian every easter. One part of me wants to head to the mountains with "everyone else," and another simply wants to enjoy a silent and eerie Oslo.</p>

<p>Turns out it's not an either-or conundrum!</p>

<p>We got to spend the first weekend of this easter holiday at a friend's cabin, while we'll spend the rest of the week back home in Oslo. Hoping to make it a tradition.</p>

<p>Sometimes you ask, and the universe answers, or maybe you just got clear on what you wanted and made it happen 🤪</p>

<p>As with every school holiday, no content outside this email. Therefore no schedule!</p>

<p>Does your country celebrate easter?</p>

<p>All the best,\
Queen Raae</p>
