        <p>I spent most of yesterday trying not to look up the promised Twitter pricing so that I could react live on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/0YUvhEmHh_w">unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt</a>.</p>

<p>However, there was not much to react to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paid plan: 100 USD a month with

<ul>
<li>for low level of API usage (whatever that means)</li>
<li>max 1,500 tweets created per month</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fee plan: there will still be one 🤪</li>
</ul>

<p>We still have no idea if Prune your Follows can run on the free plan. 100 USD a month is a lot to swing for a side project such as Prune your Follows if that is where we land.</p>

<p>Let's all cross our fingers that we'll be fine on the "new" free plan 🤞</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the best,\
