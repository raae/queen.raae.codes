        <p><strong>Breaking news:</strong> Netlify Acquires Gatsby 🤯</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Netlify/status/1620821991627309056"><img src="./twitter.com_Netlify.jpg" alt="We're thrilled to announce that we have acquired Gatsby Inc.! Together we will build the future of composable, and empower developers with flexibility and choice in building composable web experiences." /></a></p>

<p>The funny thing is I talked about JavaScript framework business models with pirate @tujoworker when meeting him in real life earlier in the day.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tujoworker/status/1620827519757979651"><img src="./twitter.com_raae.jpg" alt="Wow, and I just talked today with @raae about JavaScript framework business models ✨" /></a></p>

<p>It seems to me they are betting on Valhalla. Still, they also promise to be "good stewards of the Gatsby open-source project and the maintainers will join the open source group together with the creators of frameworks like Solid JS and Eleventy."</p>

<p>Time will tell!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the best,\
