        <p>How would you send an email 10 days from now in your app?</p>

<p>Below is a cleaned-up version of my response to <a href="https://twitter.com/Sniper2804/status/1701883884936548765">Aditya Malani</a> when he asked this question on x-bird app.</p>

<p><strong>Drip Campaigns:</strong> Platforms like <a href="https://userlist.com/">Userlist</a>, <a href="https://convertkit.com/">ConvertKit</a>, or <a href="https://outseta.com/?via=queen">Outseta</a> offer capabilities to set up drip campaigns with delays you may trigger from your app.</p>

<p><strong>Email Scheduling:</strong> Services like like <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> and <a href="https://mailchimp.com/features/transactional-email">Mailchimp Transactional</a> let you schedule emails in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Cron job:</strong> Set up a cron job (for Node, there is <a href="https://github.com/node-cron/node-cron">node-cron</a>) to periodically check the time since the event and send an email through providers such as <a href="https://resend.com/">Resend</a> when the elapsed time hits 10 days.</p>

<p><strong>Queues:</strong> Last but not least, you may use a queue solution with delay capabilities like <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> or <a href="https://www.inngest.com/">Inngest</a> with SendGrid, Resend etc.</p>

<p>Any I missed? Any your favorite way?</p>

<p>All the best,\
Queen Raae</p>

<p>PS: Remember to move your Gatsby Cloud sites soon (mostly a reminder to myself).</p>
