        <p>School has started here in Norway, the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=(from%3Aolaholstvea)%20until%3A2023-08-15%20since%3A2023-07-15&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">#SummerOffice</a> is closed until next year, and Labour Day Weekend is coming up in the US.</p>

<p>All pointing toward the end of summer in the northern hemisphere, and maybe even the end of Gatsby?</p>

<p>Last week <a href="https://twitter.com/FredKSchott/status/1693007599803752638?s=20">FredKSchott</a> (co-creator of Astro - kinda biased fella come to think of it) stated:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FredKSchott/status/1693007599803752638?s=20"><img src="twitter.com_FredKSchott.png" alt="There have been zero commits to the Gatsby repo in the last 24 days." /></a></p>

<p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/wardpeet/status/1693014604694061194">wardpeet</a>, former tech lead at Gatsby, answered:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wardpeet/status/1693014604694061194"><img src="./twitter.com_wardpeet.png" alt="It’s dead. The whole staff is gone except one. It still works well but don’t expect major React 18 features to land" /></a></p>

<p>The "Gatsby is dead" sentiment spread like wildflowers in the community.</p>

<p>However, Netlify followed up with:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Netlify/status/1694035000734216263"><img src="./twitter.com_Netlify.png" alt="Fear not! Gatsby is vital to a great many of our customers. Updates to React 18 and Gatsby Adapters are the most imminent updates, but we’re also busy investing in platform primitives for a stronger Gatsby.js (and other frameworks too)." /></a></p>

<p>What we do know is that Gatsby Cloud will be shutting down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all Gatsby Cloud Free plan customers, your Gatsby Cloud instance will be discontinued on September 29, 2023.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also know that Gatsby powers <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/framework-popularity-on-netlify/">19% of Netlify's enterprise customers</a> - enterprise is where the money's at! Twitter-devs making blogs and portfolios, not so much.</p>

<p>This summer, Netlify <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/gatsby-adapters-realize-the-full-potential-of-gatsby-on-your-platform/">shipped adaptors</a>, making it possible for any hosting provider to run full-featured Gatsby sites. Before acquiring Gatsby, Netlify had to reverse engineer SSR, DSR, etc.</p>

<p>I am still hopeful that we'll see Gatsby evolve, but I'll be looking into Astro while also spending some more time tinkering with good old Node.</p>

<p>Totally feel the vibe of <a href="https://twitter.com/flaviocopes/status/1695421873117438152">this post doing its rounds on Twitter</a>.</p>
