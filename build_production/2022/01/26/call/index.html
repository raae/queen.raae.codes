        <p>Yesterday I made it possible to book 1-on-1 Emergency Gatsby Calls with me.</p>

<p>When you have Googled. Looked through Stack Overflow. Tried to get help in the Gatsby Discord. But you are still stuck on a reef in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, ready to give up! To abandon the ship! It's time to <a href="https://queen.raae.codes/gatsby-emergency/">book a call</a>.</p>

<h2>Sharing is caring</h2>

<p>And remember, next time you come across a Gatsby Captain stuck on a reef, let them know I can get them unstuck and help make sure they stay clear of the reef the next time around. Send them to queen.raae.codes/gatsby-emergency.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
All the best,<br />
Queen Raae</p>
