<h2>My Sunday Skill Builder Session:</h2>

<p>This Sunday, I was only supposed to prepare 1 node and get data later. What went wrong?</p>

<h2>What did I do?</h2>

<p>I prepared 1 node.</p>

<h2>Why did I do it?</h2>

<p>I did just a tiiiny task again. So that I automate it in my brain. (That rhymes, when I say it at least... 💪😺)</p>

<h2>How did I do it (WRONG)?</h2>

<p>I kept on coding further. For 2 more hours! Live on youtube. What was I thinking?</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
💪😺👍<br />
Keep your skill-building-ship afloat this week!<br />
