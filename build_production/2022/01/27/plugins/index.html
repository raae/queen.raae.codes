        <p>We've all been there; you just want to source a little here, create some pages there, and then before you know it, your gatsby-node.js is <em>as long as a bad year</em> (Norwegian proverb).</p>

<p>Code files becoming too long is not unique to gatsby-node.js. But there is a Gatsby way to solve it: plugins.</p>

<p>"But I have no idea how to publish a plugin!"</p>

<p>The good news is you do not have to!</p>

<p>You can use:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/creating-a-local-plugin/#project-structure-for-a-local-plugin">a local plugin</a>,</li>
<li>or make use of <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/workspace">yarn workspace</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In theory, you may also use npm workspace, but I can never get those to work. If you do, please tell me your secret.</p>

<p>A plugin may include more than the gatsby-node.js file. But it's the one that always gets out of hand first for me, so it's the one that pushed me to start modularizing with plugins.</p>

<p><strong>Why make use of a Gatsby plugin?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Encapsulates a feature set across gatsby-node.js, gatsby-ssr.js, gatsby-browser.js, and Serverless Functions.</li>
<li>You may even add a gatsby-config.js, but that tends to complicate things quickly.</li>
<li>Scanning the gatsby-config.js for your site makes it easy to get an overview of the feature set, assuming good naming practices.</li>
<li>If you decide to create a private (or public) set of plugins, it's an easy transition.</li>
<li>Very little boilerplate is needed: a package.json file, and you are good to go.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
Have you ever made a local plugin?</p>

All the best,<br />
