        <p>Netlify released support for Gatsby SSG and DSG today 🎉 It's been in beta since September, but this is the first stable release. Check out <a href="https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-gatsby/releases/tag/v2.0.0">their announcement</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Gatsby is still hard at work with their Gatsby Conf, and you have until tomorrow 08:59 CET to enter the Gatsby Best of 2021 Agency Awards.</p>

<p>Gatsby released <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.6/">version v4.6</a> last week. Is it just me, or are these coming more often than before? Personally, I am excited about <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.6/#tracking-image-changes-in-markdown-files">the markdown image fix</a> 🖼</p>

<p>And last but not least, Samuel Larsen-Disney released his book <a href="https://twitter.com/SamLarsenDisney/status/1487112270782025731?s=20&amp;t=Yl7K-g2Iz1rrZTRHHm65Cw">Elevating React Web Development with Gatsby: Practical guide to building performant, accessible, and interactive web apps with React and Gatsby.js 4</a>. That is one very long and promising title; I can't wait to dig in!</p>
