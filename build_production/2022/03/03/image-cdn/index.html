        <p>Yesterday's email on how to <a href="/2022-03-02-large-files/">weed out large images</a> was quite on the nose when it came to one of GatsbyConf's big reveals: Image CDN.</p>

<p>With Gatsby Image CDN transformations of images are moved from the build to on-demand, waiting for the sharp transformations a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Personally, I never got around to setting up Cloudinary or Imgix and have enjoyed the ease of using <code>gatsby-plugin-image</code>.</p>

<p>However, I am planning on sourcing more of my existing content (like the YouTube streams) into queen.raae.codes, and not having to wait around for all those images transforming would be awesome.</p>

<p>But alas, the beta so far is only for images sourced with <code>gatsby-source-contentful</code> and <code>gatsby-source-wordpress</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my site is markdown based using <code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code>, so no experimentation for me yet 😢</p>

<p>I will, of course, investigate to figure out how we as developers may add support in our custom source plugins.</p>

All the best,<br />

<p><strong>PS:</strong> I am thinking of creating a course/bootcamp on developing and releasing Gatsby Plugins. Would that be of interest to you?</p>
