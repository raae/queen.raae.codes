  <p>I hired Queen Raae to help my start-up with a really important project: demonstrating how our software can be integrated with a React application.</p>
  
  <p>This was a highly technical project that <strong>required a seasoned software engineer</strong> to execute — and teach — well. She executed the project with very little oversight, taking the requirements and delivering solid solutions through her own trial, error, and understanding of our SDK.</p>
  
  <p>It allowed us to deliver an important project that will <strong>benefit our customers for a long time to come</strong>, cost-effectively and without pulling our engineers away from their other work.</p>
