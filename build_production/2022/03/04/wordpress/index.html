        <p>The founder of Gatsby WP Themes, Alexandra, helped us "Create and Customize a Gatsby Blog Powered by WordPress" in yesterday's unauthorized and rum-fueled <a href="https://youtu.be/BzigfV2BiIE">treasure hunt</a> in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/BzigfV2BiIE"><img src="./show-screengrab.jpg" alt="Screengrab of Alexandra, Ola and me laughing" /></a></p>

<p>Like many of us in the world of web development past me created WordPress sites for a living. I stopped to focus on web apps rather than websites.</p>

<p>These days the lines are getting blurry. Content plays a big part for apps, and content sites often add more interactive functionality.</p>

<p>Current numbers put websites powered by WordPress at over 30%. That is a lot of content stored in WordPress installations.</p>

<p>And I believe it probably should stay stored there. But you should absolutly experiment with using some of that content in a Gatsy project.</p>

<p>Maybe one article or one category of posts could benefit from the Gatsby approach? Weaved together with content and functionality from somewhere else like Shopify, maybe?</p>

<p>To get off on the right foot, use a starter to get a sense of how it can be done.</p>

<p>Gatsby released a new <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-wordpress-homepage/">Gatsby + WordPress starter</a> this week, and <a href="https://gatsbywpthemes.com/">Gatsby WP Themes</a> has plugins, themes, and starters ready for you.</p>

<p>And then maybe</p>

All the best,<br />

<strong>PS:</strong> John asked in the chat if you could use .com as well as .org versions of WordPress. And yes, you may!</p>
