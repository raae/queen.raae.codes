<p>The pirate princess is back in school this week, making it the official end to our summer of leisure 🥳</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/raae/status/1550430775459434497"><img src="./summer-tweet.jpg" alt="Summer 2022 😍 But getting that itch to rev the work engine back up (a tiny notch) 👑" /></a></p>

<p>You'll be getting daily emails again, and on Thursday at 19:00 CEST, we're back with another <a href="https://youtu.be/EK74ACNxM7M">unautherized and rum-fueled treasure hunt</a> in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands 🏴‍☠️</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the best,<br />
Queen Raae</p>
