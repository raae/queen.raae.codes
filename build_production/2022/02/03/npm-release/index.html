        <p>I was sure releasing packages on npm was a super complex process! I made it into this thing only developers better than I was worthy of doing.</p>

<p>It turns out it's <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages">super straightforward</a>; any folder of code with a <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file">valid package.json</a> may become an npm package.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a free account on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.com</a></li>
<li>In your terminal, move into the folder you want to release as a package</li>
<li>Create the <code>package.json</code> with <code>npm init</code></li>
<li>Type <code>npm publish</code> and follow the promps</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it; it will now be available for anyone anywhere to use 🤯</p>

<p>If the folder of code you decide to publish is worthy of becoming a package, though, that is another discussion altogether 🤪</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
All the best,<br />
