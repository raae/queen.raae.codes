        <p>In yesterday's unauthorized and rum-fueled <a href="https://youtu.be/eaZm9MC0GeE">treasure hunt</a> in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, we tested the Gatsby Plugin Starter I have been working on.</p>

<p>Good thing we did, because in revamping the example plugin that comes with the starter, I had introduced a bug 🤦‍♀️ Watch me figure it out <a href="https://youtu.be/eaZm9MC0GeE?t=2322">live on the stream</a> 🤪</p>

<p>It was an easy enough fix, and <a href="https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-starter">@raae/gatsby-plugin-starter</a> is ready to be taken for a spin 🎉</p>

<h2>Why use the starter?</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-starter">The starter</a> is a yarn workspace with both the plugin and a demo site configured for you. It makes it super fast to get started.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Ash_Hitchcock/status/1471048277747548163?s=20&amp;t=YKN2khQAbqaLSSccqculsw"><img src="./gatsby-plugin-starter-ash.jpg" alt="Tweet by @Ash_Hitchcock: almost forgot thanks to @raae the Gatsby Plugin starter ... made the plugin blazingly fast to write, with full Semantic Release to NPM Raising hands" title="Tweet by @Ash_Hitchcock" /></a></p>

<p>But even more excitedly, it comes with <a href="https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/">Semantic Release</a> configured to release new versions of your plugin to npm based on your commit messages!</p>

<p>If automation does not make you all excited, you can <a href="https://youtu.be/eaZm9MC0GeE?t=4124">borrow some of mine</a> 🤪</p>
