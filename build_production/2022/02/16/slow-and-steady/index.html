        <p>Did you know I co-host a podcast?</p>

<p>Last summer, I was interviewed by Benedikt of Userlist on my live streaming shenanigans for his and Brian's podcast Slow&amp;Steady.</p>

<p>A podcast all about building products in public!</p>

<p><img src="recording.jpg" alt="Benedicte and Benedikt recording" /></p>

<p>Long story short, a few episodes later, I became a co-host.</p>

<p>Give it a listen if you would like a backstage view of Queen Raae; learn more about POW! — the privacy-first menstrual cycle journal (my SaaS made with Gatsby, of course 🤣) and/or Benedikt's Userlist journey.</p>

<p>Once a month-ish, you also get to hear from other product folks we admire. January was <a href="https://twitter.com/lesley_pizza">@lesley_pizza</a> of Newsletter Glue. Later this month, we interview <a href="https://twitter.com/threehourcoffee">@threehourcoffee</a> of Llama Life, and in March, it's <a href="https://twitter.com/steveruizok">@steveruizok</a> of tldraw.com.</p>
