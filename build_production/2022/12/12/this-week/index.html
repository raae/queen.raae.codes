        <p>Happy third week of advent 🕯🕯🕯<span style="opacity: 0.4">🕯</span></p>

<p>Last week was not the best. The whole family came down with something (🤧), giving you an unscheduled break from my emails and our streams.</p>

<p>Luckily we still managed to celebrate my badass mom, and former CTO, who turned 63 this weekend 🥳</p>

<p>And we are still planning on launching <a href="https://pruneyourfollows.com/">Prune your Follows</a> this week. On Thursday, to be exact, it would be extra special if you managed to give us an upvote within the first hours. That would be 09:00-10:00 CET or 12:00-01:00 AM PST.</p>

<p>We are hitting some interesting Twitter limits, and we'll need to convey that in the UI before the launch so folks don't get unexplainable failures when unfollowing. I will make it happen in time 😬</p>

<p>Xata is running a <a href="https://twitter.com/xata/status/1600186056942489600?s=20&amp;t=HReA7KG8l53LPhrLOsqBZA">Christmas Hackathon</a>. If you want to participate and need any help, let us know!</p>
