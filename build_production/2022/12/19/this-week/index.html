        <p>Happy forth and last week of advent 🕯🕯🕯🕯</p>

<p>Last week we launched Prune your Follows!\
It was a blast, we broke the internet (kind of), and I'll tell you more about it tomorrow.</p>

<p>While the Pirate Princess is out of school (Thursday 22nd to January 2nd), we'll take a break from all regularly scheduled content. The streams might even wait another couple of weeks to get started in the new year. We have five family birthdays in 5 weeks, including mine 🤯</p>

<p>In 2023 would you like more of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>"follow along as we build a real app" content,</li>
<li>"this is how things are done in Gatsby" content</li>
<li>or something else, maybe?</li>
</ul>
