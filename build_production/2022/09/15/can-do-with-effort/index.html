        <p>Ahoy, skill-builder pirate of Jamstackia!</p>

<p>We looked into one useless-on-it's-own sub-task <a href="/2022-09-07-async-await/">in my last letter</a>, and I promised you this letter would be about "How do you know what type of sub-task is right to bite off for your dev-brain?"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To can't-do or NOT can't-do, that is the question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>🗣️ 💀</p>

<h2>Answer: a can't-do sub-task is bad for your brain</h2>

<p>After years of piraty experimentation on the Pirate Princess, my current conclusion is "a can't-do sub-task is bad for your brain" because it's stealing your focus like a pirate steals loot. So a can-do-with-effort sub-task is better for your focus and thus your dev-brain.</p>

<p>I'll soon tell you WHY a can't-do sub-task is stealing your focus like a pirate, but first: WHAT is a can-do-with-effort sub-task?</p>

<h2>WHAT is a can-do-with-effort sub-task?</h2>

<p>You sometimes start out with a can't-do sub-task. Then after practicing a little, it becomes a can-do-with-effort sub-task. And Then, after practicing a lot more, you have a can-do-96%-reliably sub-task because you have finally nailed your sub-task into your dev-brain.</p>

<p>Imagine a yellow board with three parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>a can't-do sub-task</li>
<li>a can-do-with-effort sub-task</li>
<li>a can-do-96%-reliably sub-task</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="./sub-task-board.png" alt="sub-task-board" /></p>

<p>You write your sub-task on a blue sticky note and move it from 1. to 2. and then to 3.</p>

<h2>WHY a can't-do sub-task is stealing your focus like a pirate?</h2>

<p>Like me, you probably also have many sub-tasks on your can-do-with-effort board. You need one less sub-task on your can-do-with-effort board. Because for each sub-task you have on your can-do-with-effort board, the harder it is for your dev-brain to focus on nailing the sub-task you're practicing in the moment. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra-ebook/dp/B00VAUIM18/">Kathy Sierra's badass book Badass</a>, having too many sub-tasks on her can-do-with-effort board is The Number One thing stealing focus and wrecking the skill-buildership of developers.</p>

<h2>HOW do you find your can-do-with-effort sub-task?</h2>

<p>A. Look back on a dev-task you did last week</p>

<p>B. Bite off a can-do-with-effort sub-task</p>

<p>Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of GO! 😺</p>

<h2>Example (Warning: summer workcation tall tales alert!&nbsp;☀️&nbsp;🗣️&nbsp;💬&nbsp;🔈)</h2>

<p>Let's look at my slightly off-topic but weirdly handy example from our piraty summer workcation.</p>

<h2>A can-do-with-effort sub-task for Lillian (7&nbsp;🏴‍☠️👸)</h2>

<p>Twisting the outboard engine handle:</p>

<ul>
<li>To go faster forward</li>
<li>To go slower forward</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your TODO</h2>

<p>Write up an idea for a sub-task and email it to Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) and me. That would help us a lot! Then bite off a can-do-with-effort sub-task from a dev-task you did last week.</p>

<p>🏴‍☠️😺👍<br />
ARR!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stay piraty 🏴‍☠️😺👍 and keep practicing!<br />
