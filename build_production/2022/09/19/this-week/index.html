        <p>We are excited to be doing some more work on Cloudinary's Gatsby Plugins this fall, and on Thursday, legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/colbyfayock">Colby Fayock</a> of Space Jelly (and Cloudinary) will be joining the unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunts in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands.</p>

<p>Thinking about JamstackConf? I have two 50% off coupons, let me know if you want one!</p>

<p>And on that note, should I wear my national costume for my talk?<br />
<small>Photo of said costume so you know what I am talking about ↓</small></p>

<p>In less self absorbent news:</p>

<p>Gatsby released v4.23 last week with some bugfixes, but also a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.23/#open-rfcs">Request for Comments (RFC)</a> on the <code>Slices</code> API that makes rebuilds happen on a component level.</p>

<p>In addition, v5 is in the works 🎉</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/36609">Umbrella Discussion on all things v5</a> on GitHub and the <a href="https://twitter.com/khaled_garbaya/status/1570048904758022148">Partial Hydration demo by Ward Peters</a> on YouTube via Twitter. We need to get Ward Peters back on the show because this is game-changing 🤯</p>
