        <p>Next week you'll get a break from my emails and the Thursday stream as it's the Easter holiday here in Norway 🐣</p>

<p>The plan is to break for all school holidays going forward.</p>

<p>But that does not mean nothing is happening around the Gatsby islands, but I am also not devastated by activity.</p>

<p>Gatsby is running a webinar, and we'll probably see them drop v4.12.</p>

<p>If you are interested in working at Gatsby, they are looking for a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/careers/">Senior Software Engineer (Full-Stack)</a>.</p>

<p>Pirate <a href="https://twitter.com/inezabonte">Ineza</a> landed his first dev job a while back, and this week Scrimba released their interview all about the process. <a href="https://twitter.com/inezabonte/status/1512076196644737034?s=20&amp;t=LIypA9gn8tgWZVWFk_cc2g">Give it a listen</a> 🎧</p>

<h2>Our streaming schedule next week</h2>

<p>🔴 🏴‍☠️ The unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunts around the Gatsby islands will be back Thursday, April 21st.</p>
