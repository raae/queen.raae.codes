        <p>It's not Monday, but I live in a long and "krokete" country, so the powers that be extended easter by one day way back when.</p>

<p>I am so ready to get back into the comfortable routine of everyday life after my month of traveling!</p>

<p>This spring, I am planning to overhaul my first ever Gatsby project: <a href="https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-remark-oembed">gatsby-remark-oembed</a> — a plugin that transforms stand alone links into its oEmbed HTML counterpart.</p>

<p>Would you like to get involved?</p>

<p>Or maybe you have your own Gatsby-related Spring plans?<br />
Let me know, and I might share it with the list 🎁</p>

<p>Last week Gatsby released v4.12. Mostly bug fixes, but also two interesting RFC (Request for Comments):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35404">RFC for new Script component in Gatsby</a> - the script component will make it easier to incorporate 3rd party scripts without negatively impacting site performance</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35357">RFC for new Bundler in Gatsby</a> - Gatsby is evaluating other bundlers in order to deliver faster local development and production build speeds</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you have any options on that, jump in with a comment.</p>
