        <p>We are finishing up the major work on the Gatsby Cloudinary plugins 🎉 If you are using Gatsby + Cloudinary, we could really need some help testing them on real projects! LMK, if that could be you 🙏</p>

<p>This week is <a href="https://reactnorway.com/">React Norway</a>. We'll get to hang out with our contact at Cloudinary and other awesome peeps as a gentle introduction to workcation 2020!</p>

<p>No streams or regular content until late August, but we'll follow up with our clients and maybe do some recreational coding. It depends on how much rain we get, I suppose ☔️</p>

<p>I do love a good workcation, as you can see in <a href="https://youtu.be/fpFY82efGPI">this vlog from 2020</a> ☀️</p>

<p>Let's hang if you find yourself on the west coast of Sweden in July or in Oslo in August. Send me a DM on Twitter, and we'll figure it out.</p>
