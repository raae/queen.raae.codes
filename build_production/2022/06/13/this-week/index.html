        <p>This week marks the last unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt around the Gatsby islands for the season. It's going to be a good one. Grayson Hicks, Staff Software Engineer at Gatsby, join us to work on Gatsby Image CDN support for his plugin <a href="https://github.com/graysonhicks/gatsby-plugin-remote-images">gatsby-plugin-remote-images</a>.</p>

<p>We'll be back in August!<br />

<p>If you, like us, could not make it to OG Deep Dive navigator Paul's meetup in San Fransisco, you may join <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/resources/webinars/achieving-performant-creativity-gatsby-rive/">Tuesday's Gatsby webinar</a>.</p>

<p>And last but not least, last week gave us <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.16/">Gatsby v4.16</a>. I am exited by <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.16/#speed-improvements-for-image-processing">Speed Improvements for Image Processing</a> ⏳</p>
