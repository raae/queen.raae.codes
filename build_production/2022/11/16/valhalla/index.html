        <p>The other day on <a href="https://twitter.com/aremu_smog/status/1592398568434069504">Twitter Aremu posted a great question</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I still can't wrap my head around what @GatsbyJS Valhalla is. I get the part where it's supposed to unify multiple content sources but couldn't you do that with normal gatsby-node.js? Is it a GUI? Is it a concept/approach to work? an npm package?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In answer, I replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's what you see when you open the graphiql explorer, but as a stand alone product to be used by any framework.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have not had time to play around with it yet. But I am very excited about what Valhalla might do for the plugin ecosystem. If they succeed, I hope it encourages CMS and other services to up their Gatsby source and transformer game.</p>

<p>All the best,<br />
