        <p>Ahoy, skill-builder pirate of Jamstackia!</p>

<p>👋😸🏴‍☠️</p>

<p>We looked into "my Again Logbook 📕" in my last letter, and today I'll start with the backstory of my plugin workbook. It's just a start, and you can start thinking about:</p>

<p>How writing your own backstory could be good for your motivation.</p>

<h2>HOW Jamstack programming used to be illegal back in the good old, OLD times</h2>

<p>You probably didn't know that, but soon you will.</p>

<h2>A long time ago, on a Bridge far, far away ....</h2>

<p>Lance-Lotta (13) is programming on her illegal Gatsby plugin.</p>

<p>«What are you DOING!» Shouts Lizabeth.</p>

<p>«I'm sourcing images from this piraty API thingy!» Says Lance-Lotta</p>

<p>«Sourcery!? You KNOW how illegal Jamstack sourcery is under the city's new anti-witchcraft laws.» Says Lizabeth.</p>

<p><img src="./lance-lotta-1.1.jpg" alt="lance-lotta" /></p>

<p>«Relax, I'll never get caught» Says Lance-Lotta.</p>

<p>«You'll never get caught?! Like you didn't get caught last week when you "borrowed" Merlina's yellow submarine and crashed it into our bridge? Or like that time you....» Says Lizabeth.</p>

<p>«Oh DO shut up or else.» Says Lance-Lotta.</p>

<p>Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of GO! 😺</p>

<h2>Your TODO</h2>

<p>Write up a sentence about your idea for your backstory and email it to Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) and me, that would help us a lot!</p>

<p>🏴‍☠️😺👍<br />
ARR!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stay piraty 🏴‍☠️😺👍 and keep practicing!<br />
