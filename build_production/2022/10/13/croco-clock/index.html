        <p>Ahoy, skill-builder pirate of Jamstackia!</p>

<p>In my last letter, we looked into <a href="/2022-09-29-automate/">Don't let Distraction Diaz distract you</a>. Today, I'll show you my favorite focus tool to determine when your sub-task practice session is done. It's my great-grandfather Captain Crook's croco clock. 🐊 ⏲️ We'll look at:</p>

<p>What a croco-clock is,
Why it can help you focus and
How you use it.</p>

<h2>WHAT is a croco-clock 🐊 ⏲️ ?</h2>

<p>A croco-clock 🐊 can be an egg clock ⏲️ that goes ARRR! when your sub-task practice session is done.</p>

<p>Then you can stop</p>

<p><img src="./by-croc.jpg" alt="Sketch of Captain Croc" /></p>

<h2>WHY could a croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ help you to focus like a pirate?</h2>

<p>Firstly you decide to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain. This is good for your focus.</p>

<p>Secondly, by starting your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ you confirm to yourself your decision to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain</p>

<p>Thirdly, the clock is literally ticking, and you know you have this ONE practice session to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain.</p>

<h2>HOW do you use your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ ?</h2>

<ol>
<li>You set your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ to for example, 96 minutes</li>
<li>And place it in another room, especially if you are using your cellphone</li>
<li>You do your sub-task in exactly the same way again and again</li>
<li>Keep doing your sub-task again and again until your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ goes ARRR! even past the point, you feel you are already doing your sub-task 96%-reliably</li>
<li>Because you're a practice pirate and this sub-task will be YOUR treasure only when you have it automated into your dev-brain</li>
</ol>

<p>Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of GO! 😺</p>

<h2>Your TODO</h2>

<p>Write up a sentence about your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ experiments and email it to Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) and me; that would help us a lot!</p>

<p>🏴‍☠️😺👍<br />
ARR!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stay piraty 🏴‍☠️😺👍 and keep practicing!<br />
