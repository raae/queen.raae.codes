<p>👋😸🏴‍☠️</p>

<p>We looked into "my favorite focus tool to find out when your sub-task practice session is done, <a href="/2022-10-13-croco-clock/">the croco-clock 🐊-⏲️</a>" in my last letter. Today I'll show you The Again Logbook 📕.</p>

<p>We'll look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>What The Again Logbook 📕 is,</li>
<li>Why it can help you to do your sub-task again and again</li>
<li>How you use The Again Logbook 📕</li>
</ul>

<h2>WHAT is The Again Logbook 📕?</h2>

<p>The Again Logbook can be a little red notebook. Here is mine; the Queen bought it for me in Greece.</p>

<p><img src="./The-Again-Logbook-2.3.jpg" alt="The-Again-Logbook" /></p>

<h2>WHY could The Again Logbook 📕 help you to do your sub-task again and again?</h2>

<p>Firstly you decide to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain. This is good for your motivation. Your personal value increases with each sub-task you have automated into your dev-brain.</p>

<p>Secondly, by deciding to do your sub-task six times, or whatever you choose, you confirm to yourself your decision to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain.</p>

<p>Thirdly, if you give up before you have done your sub-task six times you loose.</p>

<h2>HOW do you use your Again Logbook? 📕</h2>

<ol>
<li>Set your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ to, for example 96 minutes</li>
<li>Make a row of tiny squares, as many as the repetitions you decided on</li>
<li>Each time you finish your sub-task, turn one tiny square into an "!"</li>
<li>Keep doing your sub-task again and again until your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ goes ARRR! even past your six times, but keep making a new "!" each time</li>
<li>Because doing them more times than you planned feels like winning</li>
</ol>

<p>Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of GO! 😺</p>
