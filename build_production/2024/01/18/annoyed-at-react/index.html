        <p>Last week, Cassidy Williams wrote <a href="https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/annoyed-at-react/">Kind of annoyed at React</a>, and I wholeheartedly agree with her train of thought.</p>

<p>In it, she mentioned that the latest <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v18.2.0">React</a> release was in June 2022 🤯</p>

<p>That made me peek at the release note again, reminding me that React Server Components (RSC) are still experimental.</p>

<p>And together with experiences like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every time a new developer picked up our codebase, the questions came up: “What’s running on the server? What’s running on the client?” Every PR had feedback regarding something accidentally/unnecessarily shipped to the client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>mentioned in <a href="https://www.mux.com/blog/what-are-react-server-components">​Everything I Wish I Knew before moving 50,000 lines of code to React Server Components​</a> it makes me cautious, very cautious.</p>

<p>But it's always a good idea to try to understand a concept, and for that, I recommend Josh Comeau's post <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/server-components/">Making Sense of React Server Components</a>.</p>
