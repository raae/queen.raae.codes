        <p>I signed up for Amy's inaugural <a href="https://www.twoweekbuild.com/">Two-Week Build Challenge</a>. And there is still time for you to sign up!</p>

<p>Let me know if you need some added accountability. We could set up co-working sessions 🎉</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pick Something to Build</li>
<li>Build it in 2 Weeks</li>
<li>Ship it</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules and Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
<li>Have fun.</li>
<li>Don’t overthink it.</li>
<li>Don’t start until March 1, 2024.</li>
<li>You can build anything. Write an ebook. Design a UI library. Build a web application.</li>
<li>At the end of 2 weeks, ship what you have.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm building a, Astro website for our podcast Data in the Wild launching in April now that all episodes of season 1 are recorded.</p>

<p>And I plan on <a href="https://youtube.com/QueenRaae/live">live streaming</a> every day starting Monday, the 4th.</p>

<p>But if I fold or skip some, that is also okay...</p>

<p>👷‍♀️</p>
