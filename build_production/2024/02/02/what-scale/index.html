        <p>Always ask for numbers when someone wants your help with a web project that needs to be able to scale.</p>

<ul>
<li>How many users?</li>
<li>How many transactions?</li>
<li>How many uploads?</li>
</ul>

<p>Even a company with all of the Norwegian population (5.4 million) as its possible customer base will never get close to what an Amazon or a Spotify would need in terms of scale.</p>

<p>When I asked, "How many customers are we talking about scaling to in the next three years, best case?" in a meeting this week, the answer was 900.</p>

<p>900 customers with no uploads, posts, or multiple transactions per customer, and all traffic to the site is coming from within Norway. Maybe not all; someone might log in while on vacation. But you get my point.</p>

<p>All the buzzwords are void.</p>

<p>No need for replications of edge functions across the globe, no need to handle 1000s of simultaneous requests, no need for real-time SDK, and the list goes on.</p>
