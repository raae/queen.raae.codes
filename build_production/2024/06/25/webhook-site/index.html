        <p>When working on integrations sometimes you simply need to see exactly what is sent to the webhook. That's not always easy to know, especially if the webhook is triggered by a third-party service or even when received by a third-party service.</p>

<p>When working with the newly released <a href="https://framer.link/queen-raae">Framer</a> Forms I needed a quick way to check exactly what was sent to the webhook and remembered a tool I've used before: <a href="https://webhook.site/">Webhook.site</a>.</p>

<p>Writing it down to hopefully remember this possibility faster the next time I need it. And maybe it can help you too!</p>
