        <p>Yesterday's <a href="https://youtu.be/lVMNrThbQOM">unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunts in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands</a> tiny-task was "accept donations."</p>

<p>We did so by adding soon-to-be-officially released plugin: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@raae/gatsby-plugin-donations">@raae/gatsby-plugin-donations</a>.</p>

<p>The plugin adds a Gatsby Serverless Function you may use to accept pay-what-you-want donations. No ready-made components yet...</p>

<p>I wanted to test out the developer experience myself. Having Ola walk me through the steps in the readme and keep an eye out for areas to improve.</p>

<p>Pretty happy with the results, but some clarification is needed before it's ready for an official release.</p>

<p>We also tackled an issue reported by an early tester:</p>

<p>404 error when using the supplied example code...</p>

<p>Turns out he was using Gatsby version 3.2, and I had somehow put ^3.0.0 as a valid peer dependency when in fact, support for Gatsby Serverless Functions came with version 3.7 🤦‍♀️</p>

<p>Where was Paul, you might ask? He was living out his dream as an Englishman in New York.</p>

<p>If you decide to test out the new plugin, I would love to hear what you think over in the discussions.</p>

<p>All the best,<br />
