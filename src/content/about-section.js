        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a seasoned web developer who loves duct-taping together side
          projects in addition to making apps trusted by the Swedish Armed
          Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and
          others.

          Gatsby came into my life in 2018. Since then, I have created
          gatsby-remark-oembed (open-source Gatsby plugin) and spoken at Gatsby
          Days 2019 and Gatsby Fall Camp 2021.
        </p>

          On International Women's day 2020 I launced POW! â€” the privacy-first
          menstrual cycle journal. A web app created with, you guessed it,
          Gatsby!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have learned a lot about how to get the most out of Gatsby, and I am
          exited to share that with you{" "}
