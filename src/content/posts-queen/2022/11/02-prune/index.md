Join us as we add the last finishing touches to the beta version of [Prune your Follows](https://pruneyourfollows.com) on our [unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt](https://youtu.be/RFrQjA066sI) today (19:00 CET)!

It's looking pretty slick, if I may say so myself 🤪

And it is already testable on [pruneyourfollows.com](https://pruneyourfollows.com). Let us know of any bugs you find by joining [the chat](https://youtu.be/RFrQjA066sI) 💬

Not done: unfollowed and followed in the navigation.

All the best,
