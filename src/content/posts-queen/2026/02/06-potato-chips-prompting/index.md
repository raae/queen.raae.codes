Back in March I ended up comparing AI prompting to eating potato chips on the podcast.

> "It's like when you are eating potato chips. Just like one more. It's gonna be fine. One more."

That was almost a year ago and it still holds true.

After a very productive day working on extracting ideas and themes from Slow & Staeady transcrips.. I've been going back and forth with Jean Claude on this one thing. Every prompt feels like the one that'll fix it.
But I've been saying that for the last fifteen minutes and I'm noticing tension in my neck and it's like I'm punishing the keyboard with every prompt 😬

So I'm taking my own advice, writing this instead.

I should have stepped away earlier step back, think about what I actually want, and write a proper prompt. Not another quick "no, not like that, more
like this" — an actual, thought-through prompt with real context and a clear outcome.

And the longer I don't do that, the worse it gets. Every bad iteration pollutes the conversation. Jean Claude is now working with a context full of wrong turns
and half-fixes and contradicting instructions. At some point the context is basically corrupted and no prompt is going to save it. Starting a fresh conversation
with one good prompt would get me further than twenty more chips in the current one.

I know this. I still don't do it.

AI has come pretty far. I [one-shotted a gated content demo](/2026/02/06/one-shot) last week and my mind was pretty blown. But it hasn't come far enough to read
my mind when I'm too lazy to think through what I actually need.

Anyway. I'm going to watch Bridgerton now 🤓
