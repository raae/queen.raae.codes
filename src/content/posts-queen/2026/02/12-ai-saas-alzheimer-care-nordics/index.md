Svein, you asked me about AI SaaS opportunities. I've been thinking about this a lot—probably more than most, given my years caring for my mom with early onset Alzheimer's.

So here's my honest take: **dementia care in the Nordics is ripe for disruption.**

## The numbers don't lie

Over 500,000 people are living with dementia in the Nordic region right now. That number will **double by 2050**. Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland all rank in the global top 10 for Alzheimer's rates.

And here's what hit me hard: 65% of people over 90 show Alzheimer's-related brain changes. We're not talking about a niche problem.

## Why Norway specifically?

Norway has something most countries don't: a Dementia Plan 2025 that *explicitly* calls for AI tools to improve diagnosis. The government is actively seeking tech solutions. They've even allocated what they call the "AI billion"—establishing up to 6 new AI research centers in 2025.

Plus, Norwegian municipalities are already using welfare technology. Sensors, remote monitoring, fall detection—the infrastructure exists. What's missing is the **intelligence layer** that makes sense of all that data.

## Where the gaps are

From my research and, honestly, from living this reality:

**1. Early detection in primary care**
GPs don't have time. An AI that scans existing health records for early warning signs? There's already an open-source tool from Regenstrief Institute that increased diagnosis rates by 31%—using data doctors already have. Nobody's adapted it for Nordic languages and systems yet.

**2. Family caregiver support**
This is personal. When you're caring for someone with dementia, you're drowning. You need education, monitoring alerts, care coordination—all in one place. The WHO has a framework called iSupport, but there's no proper SaaS implementation for Nordic families.

**3. Making sense of sensor data**
Norwegian company Sensio saved one municipality NOK 1.8 million per patient by letting people live at home longer. But their sensor data could be so much smarter with proper AI analysis. Predictive analytics for care teams is wide open.

**4. Speech-based screening**
A tool from University of Sheffield achieves 90% accuracy detecting Alzheimer's from speech patterns alone. It works in English. Who's building the Norwegian version?

## The regulatory reality

No sugarcoating: you'll need to navigate the EU AI Act, which applies to Norway through EEA. Healthcare AI is classified as high-risk, with full compliance deadlines in August 2027.

But—and this is key—Norway has a regulatory sandbox through the Data Protection Authority, and the Directorate of Health offers guidance specifically for AI projects. They want this to work.

## Who's already playing

- **Sensio** — AI-powered sensors for dementia care homes
- **Motitech** — VR cycling that actually reduces dementia symptoms
- **Dignio** — Remote patient monitoring
- **Vitalthings** — Contactless vital signs (perfect for people who can't manage wearables)

There's activity, but nobody has cracked the full platform play yet. The market is fragmented.

## My honest advice

Start with caregiver support. It's the least regulated entry point, the need is desperate, and you can expand into clinical tools once you've built trust and data.

The municipal procurement cycle is slow but predictable. Partner with one kommune, prove the ROI (hint: it's about extending home-living duration), and you'll have a playbook for the rest.

And Svein? Build it **with** families and patients, not just for them. That's the Nordic way—and it's also why Nordic AgeTech actually works.

This market will be massive. The question is who builds the tools our families deserve.

Caring for my mom taught me one thing: the system needs help. Let's build it.
