            I had never worked with serverless before, I assumed it was a topic that was way out of my league. But you
            proved me wrong! One aspect that I liked was the live sessions we had on crowdcast. I got the opportunity to
            ask questions and watch you code an application step by step. I would definitely recommend your bootcamps to
            others because this is a great opportunity to learn about emerging technologies and also connect with
            amazing people.

        <h2>A little bit of backend in your life</h2>
        <p>Do you want to add some backend functionality to your Gatsby site?</p>

        <h2>A little bit of Serverless on your side</h2>
        <p>But have no idea how to get started with the backend?</p>

        <h2>A little bit of Gatsby is all you need</h2>
        <p>
          With Gatsby Serverless Functions, you can write backend code without leaving your Gatsby project or learning a
          new framework!
        </p>

        <h3>What you'll make?</h3>
        <p>
          During this bootcamp, we'll be working on <strong>TimeShip</strong> &mdash; an app that lets you send messages to
          the future. We'll use Gatsby Serverless Functions to power the backend that stores and retrieves these time-traveling
          messages.
        </p>

        <h3>What you'll learn?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How to set up and configure Gatsby Serverless Functions</li>
          <li>How to create API endpoints in your Gatsby project</li>
          <li>How to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST)</li>
          <li>How to connect to external services from your functions</li>
          <li>How to deploy your functions to production</li>

            My name is Benedicte Raae, aka Queen Raae. I have been coding since the late '90s. I hold a Master of
            Science in Computer Science and have made apps for the Swedish Armed Forces, numerous startups and agencies,
            as well as my own startup POW! that made an app with more than 200.000 users.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have spoken at Gatsby Days and I am an active member of the Gatsby community, streaming live on YouTube
            every week.

          <p>
            I would and I have recommended your bootcamps to others because for me, it wasn't just about creating
            serverless functions, it was in fact a mini-crash course into the art of software engineering in itself. It
            cleared my doubts about my abilities to pull things off and seeing everyone go at it really helped boost my
            confidence delving into unfamiliar paths.
