            I had never worked with serverless before, I assumed it was a topic that was way out of my league. But you
            proved me wrong! One aspect that I liked was the live sessions we had on crowdcast. I got the opportunity to
            ask questions and watch you code an application step by step. I would definitely recommend your bootcamps to
            others because this is a great opportunity to learn about emerging technologies and also connect with
            amazing people.

            My name is Benedicte Raae, aka Queen Raae. I have been coding since the late '90s. I hold a Master of
            Science in Computer Science and have made apps for the Swedish Armed Forces, numerous startups and agencies,
            as well as my own startup POW! that made an app with more than 200.000 users.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have spoken at Gatsby Days and I am an active member of the Gatsby community, streaming live on YouTube
            every week.

            I would and I have recommended your bootcamps to others because for me, it wasn't just about creating
            serverless functions, it was in fact a mini-crash course into the art of software engineering in itself. It
            cleared my doubts about my abilities to pull things off and seeing everyone go at it really helped boost my
            confidence delving into unfamiliar paths.
