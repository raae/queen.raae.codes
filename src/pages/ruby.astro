        <h2>Is your skill building stuck in the suck zone?</h2>
        <p>You know the suck zone. It's where you are when you start learning something new. You suck at it. You know you suck at it. And it feels like you'll never get out of it.</p>
        <p>You read the docs. You watch the tutorials. You copy the code. But you still suck.</p>
        <p>You need something more. You need a reason to build. A reason that matters.</p>

        <h2>Imagine that your sister might die...</h2>
        <p>Imagine that you are a frontend engineer in 1554. Imagine that your sister is locked up in the Tower of London. Imagine that if you don't build the right thing, at the right time, she will be executed.</p>
        <p>Would that get you out of the suck zone?</p>

        <h2>Join Ruby Reckless on her TimeShip</h2>
        <p>Ruby Reckless is a frontend engineer. She has a TimeShip. And she has a mission: save Princess Elizabeth from the Tower of London before Queen Mary has her executed.</p>
        <p>But Ruby can't do it alone. She needs you. She needs your frontend skills. And she needs them now.</p>

        <img src="/content/landing/ruby/Family.jpg" alt="The family, Ola, Lillian and Raae" />

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>You sign up and receive the prolog of Ruby's TimeShip. Each chapter presents a new challenge that Ruby needs your help to solve. You build the solution using your frontend skills.</p>
        <p>The story motivates. The challenges teach. And before you know it, you're out of the suck zone.</p>

        <h2>About the author</h2>
        <p>Ola Vea (@OlaHolstVea) is a junior frontend engineer, aspiring author, and the Cap'n of this pirate ship. He believes that the best way to learn is through story, and that the best stories are the ones where you are the hero.</p>
        <p>Together with Queen Raae and Pirate Princess Lillian (6), he creates adventures that turn learning into play.</p>

        <h2>What are you waiting for?</h2>
        <p>The TimeShip is ready. Ruby needs your help. Princess Elizabeth's life hangs in the balance.</p>
