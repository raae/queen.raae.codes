          <p>
            I am a seasoned web developer who loves duct-taping together side
            projects in addition to making apps trusted by the Swedish Armed
            Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and
            others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gatsby came into my life in 2018. Since then, I have created
            gatsby-remark-oembed (open-source Gatsby plugin) and spoken at both
            Gatsby Days 2019 and Gatsby Fall Camp 2021.
          </p>
          <p>
            On International Women's day 2020 I launced POW! â€” the privacy-first
            menstrual cycle journal. A web app created with, you guessed it,
            Gatsby!
          </p>

            I have learned a lot about how to get the most out of Gatsby, and I
            am exited to share that with you{" "}
