&lt;p&gt;It started with a TLDraw sketch Ola made of the new Whee! theft flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a screenshot of the sketch as a starting point working with Cursor on implementing the flow. Edge cases revealed themselves. I am a big fan of TLDraw, but didn&apos;t really want to sketch it all out myself...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I remembered &lt;a href=&quot;https://mermaid.js.org&quot;&gt;Mermaid&lt;/a&gt; diagrams! Introduced to me by Kim when I did contract work at the bank. It lets you write diagrams that can be rendered by Mermaid.js. GitHub, Obsidian, Cursor and more all come with native support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```mermaid
graph LR
    Sketch --&amp;gt; Diagram --&amp;gt; Code
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renders as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-mermaid&quot;&gt;graph LR
    Sketch --&amp;gt; Diagram --&amp;gt; Code
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Before coding: spec the shape first&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together we polished the diagram. Renamed states, added edge cases. Polished more. Shared the diagram with the team for input. Once we all agreed the diagram was right — Ola, me, the product owner and the LLM — Cursor knocked out the implementation pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, the coding was not the hard part. Getting the concept correct. There was a lot to capture in that flow, and it&apos;s just easier to see in a diagram than a long description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I created a mermaid diagram of the flow and like going through all the states. And then I took some notes that he (Ola) had made in TLDraw. I screenshotted that... and I put that into Cursor.&amp;quot;
&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;🎧 Me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://slowandsteadypodcast.com/235?#t=17:50&quot;&gt;Slow &amp;amp; Steady ep. 235 (at 17:50)&lt;/a&gt; ↓&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;180&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; scrolling=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; seamless=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://share.transistor.fm/e/29d2248f?#t=17:50&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;After coding: review what the AI built&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it works both ways. Last week I asked Jean-Claude to diagram what he&apos;d built in &lt;a href=&quot;https://galleon.tools&quot;&gt;Galleon&lt;/a&gt;. Not the plan, but what had been built so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spat out an architectural overview Mermaid diagram. I looked at it for maybe ten seconds and spotted awkwardness. One concept that at the moment uses the same service, but conceptually is two different things and should be modelled as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-mermaid&quot;&gt;graph TB
    Dashboard[&amp;quot;Dashboard&amp;quot;]
    GhostSource[&amp;quot;Ghost Source Service&amp;quot;]
    GhostIdentity[&amp;quot;Ghost Identity Service&amp;quot;]

    Dashboard --&amp;gt;|&amp;quot;connect ghost&amp;quot;| J((&amp;quot; &amp;quot;))
    J --&amp;gt; GhostSource
    J --&amp;gt; GhostIdentity
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📹 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/e2IAxtvFFFk&quot;&gt;See the workflow in action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The real win: same diagram, multiple audiences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagrams FTW!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Whee, the theft flow diagram helped us get sign-off from the product owner. It helped Ola, who&apos;s more junior, understand the flow and all its edge cases. And honestly, it helped me wrap my head around all the edge cases before implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Galleon where I&apos;m testing out an AI-heavy workflow, it&apos;s helped build a shared understanding between Jean-Claude, Ola and I. As an added bonus: better docs along the way than I&apos;ve ever had before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Galleon is a semi-stealth side project Queen Raae is building with Ola.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Queen Raae is the fCTO of Whee!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>📝 ✨ ~ The AI gain isn&apos;t speed.

AI made them &lt;strong&gt;19% slower&lt;/strong&gt;. Not faster. Slower. And the developers themselves thought it had saved them 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortune ran it as &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/article/does-ai-increase-workplace-productivity-experiment-software-developers-task-took-longer/&quot;&gt;AI hampered productivity of software developers&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; It got so much publicity I had friends quoting it to me and my dad sent it on the family WhatsApp asking my take. Looking up the chat I see my answer was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot to say about that study. But gotta pack!
&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Me to my dad on WhatsApp&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./whatsapp-conversation.png&quot; alt=&quot;WhatsApp conversation with my dad about the study&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not questioning their findings. But I wonder if they measured the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study gave developers assigned tasks and timed them. It measured how fast you do things you were already going to do. It didn&apos;t measure the things I would never have started without AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never did reply to my dad. But Jean-Claude did help me start this blog post. So dad, here&apos;s your answer 😆&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like these emails I was trying to write in September to reconnect with old collaborators from a past project. Not complicated emails, but ones you, or at least I, dread to write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&apos;s just so hard, like it takes so much time. But not so much time in doing it, but just like procrastinating doing it... I&apos;ve been like, you know, pushing it in front of me and then sitting down to write these emails is like, what do you write in these emails?
&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;🎧 Me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://slowandsteadypodcast.com/228?#t=01:08&quot;&gt;Slow &amp;amp; Steady 228@01:08 (September 2025)&lt;/a&gt; ↓&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;180&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; scrolling=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; seamless=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://share.transistor.fm/e/c88aa2f3?#t=01:08&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I asked Jean-Claude to write them. He gave me a draft and it was... not great. But that was the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benedikt nailed why this works — it&apos;s the coin-flip trick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s like that test trick when you can&apos;t decide between two things. You just ask someone else to make the decision and then you don&apos;t blindly take that decision as yours. You judge your emotional reaction to it and then you know what you would want.
&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;🎧 Benedikt on &lt;a href=&quot;https://slowandsteadypodcast.com/228?#t=03:24&quot;&gt;Slow &amp;amp; Steady 228@03:24 (September 2025)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t need a good draft. You need &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; draft to react to. The reaction tells you what you actually wanted to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s one flavor of procrastination — not knowing what to say. There&apos;s another one: knowing exactly what needs doing, just not wanting to start. In our latest episode, Benedikt described that one too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind blown [...] There&apos;s a couple of things I wanted to do for a long time, but I knew would be cumbersome because a lot of small changes to a lot of small files... I realized that now with AI support, I could get over that initial hump of getting from nothing to somewhat working, relatively quickly. And then actually spend more time on the part that I enjoy doing.
&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;🎧 Benedikt on &lt;a href=&quot;https://slowandsteadypodcast.com/235?#t=21:29&quot;&gt;Slow &amp;amp; Steady 235@21:29 (January 2026)&lt;/a&gt; ↓&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;180&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; scrolling=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; seamless=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://share.transistor.fm/e/29d2248f?#t=21:29&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shipped more annoying stuff in two weeks than he had all year. And then got to spend his time on the part he actually enjoys — the cleanup, the refactoring, the making-it-good part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gain isn&apos;t speed. It&apos;s starting. AI cuts the starting cost to near zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d love to see a study that measures the time we spend &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; starting, not just how fast we finish. Is there a gain in the overall time? In efforts started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if many of those things AI helps us start should have stayed undone? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of. OAuth flows are working. But the schemas are hard to automatically generate, so I&apos;ve been looking into replacing the current serializer library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was like hold up, hold up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your API send back proper error messages? You know, if I send a too long title when scheduling a broadcast, does it tell me it&apos;s too long?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. It does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then ship it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These models are genuinely good at figuring things out now. When our friend Jean-Claude hits an error, he will read the error message and try again. You might be on the hook for more tokens than necessary, but he will get it right eventually. And if you are lucky he remembers how to do it right the next time 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out it&apos;s not just me saying this. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/server/tools#error-handling&quot;&gt;MCP spec&lt;/a&gt; itself says tool execution errors &amp;quot;contain actionable feedback that language models can use to self-correct and retry with adjusted parameters.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the folks using MCP servers for marketing right now? They&apos;re not sitting there watching each API call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They&apos;re just YOLOing things and sending them off into subagents. So if it takes four tries to get this broadcast up, they&apos;re not even gonna see that. They&apos;re just gonna see it when it&apos;s done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://slowandsteadypodcast.com/236?#t=33:07&quot;&gt;Slow &amp;amp; Steady ep. 236 (at 33:07)&lt;/a&gt; ↓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;180&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; scrolling=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; seamless=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://share.transistor.fm/e/0ec939c2?#t=33:07&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not saying schemas don&apos;t matter. They do! Rich descriptions, proper types, field constraints — all of that makes the experience smoother. But out the gate you&apos;re fine with &amp;quot;title is a string&amp;quot;. Better done, than perfect as they say at Userlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of MCP Servers, my next step for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://outseta.com/?via=queen&quot;&gt;Outseta&lt;/a&gt; MCP is to publish it as a remote MCP server making it accessible for those not ready to npx @outseta/outseta-mcp. And yeah, I&apos;ve been stuck picking the perfect hosting setup. Same trap, different serializer library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s the MCP you&apos;ve been not-shipping? 😬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&apos;s like when you are eating potato chips. Just like one more. It&apos;s gonna be fine. One more.&amp;quot;
— Me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://slowandsteadypodcast.com/219?#t=46:57&quot;&gt;Slow &amp;amp; Steady ep. 219 (at the 46:57 mark)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was almost a year ago and it still holds true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a productive day extracting &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/raae/status/2019747239787118814?s=20&quot;&gt;my voice, ideas and themes from Slow &amp;amp; Steady transcripts&lt;/a&gt;, I&apos;ve been going back and forth with Jean-Claude on this very post. Every prompt feels like the one that&apos;ll nail it. But I&apos;ve been saying that for way too long and I&apos;m noticing tension in my neck and it&apos;s like I&apos;m trying to kill the keyboard with every prompt 😬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have stepped back earlier. Think about what I actually want, write a proper prompt 🤦‍♀️ Not another quick &amp;quot;no, not like that, more like this&amp;quot; — an actual, thought-through prompt with real context and a clear outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m far into context rot territory. Starting a fresh conversation with one good prompt would get me further than twenty more chips in the current one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this. I still don&apos;t do it. Perhaps I should take my own advice and step away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI has come pretty far since March of last year. I even &lt;a href=&quot;/2026-02-06-it-one-shotted-it/&quot;&gt;one-shotted an Outseta demo&lt;/a&gt; last week. However it has not come far enough to &lt;strong&gt;read my mind when I&apos;m too lazy to think through what I actually need&lt;/strong&gt; (LOL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I&apos;m going to watch Bridgerton now 📺&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any other screens present. And no agent going.&lt;/p&gt;

And it one-shotted it. Completely correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./cursor-one-shot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cursor one-shotting the Outseta + Next.js gated content article&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried this a while back. Same kind of task — integrate Outseta. And I could not for the life of me get it to work. It kept inventing a react SDK that didn&apos;t exist, even when I gave it the exact script set up I wanted in the header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this time: &lt;strong&gt;Boom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked through the code and the Outseta integration was there, the exact way I would have done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear me talk about it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://slowandsteadypodcast.com/235?#t=16:19&quot;&gt;Slow &amp;amp; Steady ep. 235 (at the 16:19 mark)&lt;/a&gt; ↓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;180&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; scrolling=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; seamless=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://share.transistor.fm/e/29d2248f?#t=16:19&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ve gone from &amp;quot;I think we need to change how Outseta works in order to work with AI&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;AI can actually do it the way we expect it to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s a pretty big shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what changed? I think it&apos;s the model. But it could be that I&apos;ve gotten better at the context stuff as well...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was testing way back when, as in mid last year (2025), I tried all kinds of ways. Concrete step-by-step instructions, detailed specs, minimal specs, full access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://outseta.com/?via=queen&quot;&gt;Outseta&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s knowledge base, you name it. Still garbage. Now I pasted in a single knowledge base article and the AI just got it. But here&apos;s the thing...The article was written with the help of Claude 😬 and I&apos;m much more experienced prompt engineer these days. Perhaps that&apos;s what made the difference. Or a bit of both? Honestly, I&apos;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might actually test this. Same article, same prompt, different models. See who one-shots it and who tries to download an SDK that doesn&apos;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned 🤓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s frustrating because the code looks right, it&apos;s in the right place, but Framer just... ignores it. Something I also personally experienced when creating my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://outseta.com/?via=queen&quot;&gt;Outseta&lt;/a&gt; code overrides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s what usually happens. You write what feels like a perfectly reasonable code override:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;// ❌ This won&apos;t show up in the override panel
import { forwardRef } from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export const WithClick = (Component) =&amp;gt; {
  return forwardRef((props, ref) =&amp;gt; {
    const handleClick = () =&amp;gt; {
      console.log(&amp;quot;Clicked!&amp;quot;);
    };

    return &amp;lt;Component {...props} ref={ref} onClick={handleClick} /&amp;gt;;
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You save the file, go back to the Framer canvas, and... nothing. The override doesn&apos;t appear in the dropdown. No error message, no explanation. It&apos;s like your code doesn&apos;t even exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framer has specific requirements for code overrides to show up in the panel. It&apos;s not just about writing a function - the function needs to follow a particular &lt;strong&gt;signature&lt;/strong&gt; that Framer recognizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, code overrides must be properly typed with React&apos;s &lt;code&gt;ComponentType&lt;/code&gt; as the return type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;// ✅ This will show up in the override panel
import { forwardRef, ComponentType } from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export const WithClick = (Component): ComponentType =&amp;gt; {
  return forwardRef((props, ref) =&amp;gt; {
    const handleClick = () =&amp;gt; {
      console.log(&amp;quot;Clicked!&amp;quot;);
    };

    return &amp;lt;Component {...props} ref={ref} onClick={handleClick} /&amp;gt;;
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s it. The &lt;code&gt;ComponentType&lt;/code&gt; return type annotation is what tells Framer &amp;quot;hey, this is a valid override!&amp;quot; Without it, Framer has no way to know your function is meant to be an override.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t really explained in the error messages (because there are no error messages 🤦‍♀️), and it&apos;s not super obvious from the docs either. But once you know it, it makes sense and now you know 🥳&lt;/p&gt;

Canvas — The…</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re building code components or code overrides for &lt;a href=&quot;https://framer.link/queen-raae&quot;&gt;Framer&lt;/a&gt;, you&apos;ll want to handle three different render modes: canvas, preview, and live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canvas&lt;/strong&gt; — The Framer editor. Your component is rendered as a static preview while designing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preview&lt;/strong&gt; — Preview mode. Interactive, but still in the Framer environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live&lt;/strong&gt; — The published site where custom code such as the Outseta script executes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly (at least to me 😆), Framer&apos;s &lt;code&gt;RenderTarget&lt;/code&gt; returns &amp;quot;preview&amp;quot; for both preview and live as I&apos;ve defined them. This makes sense for design, but not for more app-like functionality as I&apos;ve found out while building &lt;a href=&quot;https://outseta.com/?via=queen&quot;&gt;Outseta&lt;/a&gt; code overrides and components that depend on the execution of custom code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some trial and error, I found the most robust way to distinguish between preview and live is to check the hostname. If it includes &amp;quot;framercanvas.com&amp;quot;, it&apos;s preview, otherwise it&apos;s live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live is intentionally the fallback mode, so if Framer changes the preview hostname the component will still work as expected in the more crucial live mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-tsx&quot;&gt;import { RenderTarget } from &amp;quot;framer&amp;quot;;

type RenderMode = &amp;quot;canvas&amp;quot; | &amp;quot;preview&amp;quot; | &amp;quot;live&amp;quot;;

function getRenderMode(): RenderMode {
  const renderTarget = RenderTarget.current();

  if (renderTarget === RenderTarget.canvas) {
    return &amp;quot;canvas&amp;quot;;
  } else if (renderTarget === RenderTarget.preview &amp;amp;&amp;amp; window?.location.host.includes(&amp;quot;framercanvas.com&amp;quot;)) {
    return &amp;quot;preview&amp;quot;;
  } else {
    return &amp;quot;live&amp;quot;;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why not do feature checks instead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a valid approach — we could check for the presence of the Outseta script and only continue with Outseta logic if present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-tsx&quot;&gt;if (typeof Outseta !== &amp;quot;undefined&amp;quot;) {
  // Outseta is available, do the thing
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This handles the error, but it doesn&apos;t give you control over the designer experience. With feature checks alone we&apos;re not asking &amp;quot;what experience should I provide for this mode?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With explicit mode handling you can, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add props like &lt;code&gt;showOnPreview&lt;/code&gt; to force a specific state, letting designers preview logged-in views without having to publish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write to the console in live mode when the Outseta script is missing and remove the component — but in preview mode a missing script is expected, so no need to clutter the console with warnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skip analytics events in canvas and preview — only fire them in live mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And so on...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Framer code runs in three modes:&lt;/strong&gt; canvas, preview, and live — each needs different behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External scripts only run in live mode&lt;/strong&gt; — your code needs fallbacks for canvas and preview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live as fallback is intentional&lt;/strong&gt; — if Framer changes their preview hostname, your published site still works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mode checks &amp;gt; feature checks&lt;/strong&gt; — they give you control over the designer experience, not just error avoidance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your approach to handling render modes in Framer? Are there edge cases I haven&apos;t covered? I&apos;d love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy building! 🛠️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.framer.community/c/developers/copy-current-page-link-button-cms-supported&quot;&gt;question about how to add a &amp;quot;copy link&amp;quot; code override&lt;/a&gt; and threw together a code override.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are Code Overrides?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code overrides are Higher Order React Components that wrap around &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; on the Framer canvas. So if you are a React developer, you can use code overrides to add all sorts of functionality to a Framer site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framer is really onto something here with seperating design from functionality 🤩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ask&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the current page URL to the clipboard with a Code Override.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lightweight Code Override that adds copy-to-clipboard functionality to any element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;import { forwardRef, type ComponentType } from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export function withCopyURL(Component): ComponentType {
  return forwardRef((props, ref) =&amp;gt; {
    const handleClick = async () =&amp;gt; {
      try {
        const currentURL = window.location.href;
        await navigator.clipboard.writeText(currentURL);
        console.log(&amp;quot;URL copied to clipboard:&amp;quot;, currentURL);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(&amp;quot;Failed to copy URL:&amp;quot;, err);
      }
    };

    return &amp;lt;Component ref={ref} {...props} onClick={handleClick} style={{ cursor: &amp;quot;pointer&amp;quot; }} /&amp;gt;;
  });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Use It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Framer, open the &lt;strong&gt;Assets&lt;/strong&gt; panel and go to the &lt;strong&gt;Code&lt;/strong&gt; tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; button to create a new Code Override file and name it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste the code above into the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select any element on your canvas (a button, icon, or text layer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the properties panel, find &lt;strong&gt;Code Override&lt;/strong&gt; and select &lt;code&gt;withCopyURL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s it! Now when someone clicks that element, the current page URL gets copied to their clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add visual feedback like hover states or tap animation in the Framer canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going Further&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could extend this Code Override to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a toast notification after copying (&amp;quot;Link copied!&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy a custom URL instead of the current one (great for referral links)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track copy events in your analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; The Clipboard API works in all modern browsers, but it requires a secure context (HTTPS). It&apos;ll work fine on your published Framer site, but might act up on localhost without HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I teased the stream with &amp;quot;Will it #AI?&amp;quot; a nod to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/lAl28d6tbko&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Will it blend?&amp;quot; of yesteryear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt like the answer was unequivocally yes - Claude seamlessly pumped out the Supabase migration SQL and working React code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/FY8b3kgFUVk&quot;&gt;See me react live on stream here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing after the stream revealed that sneaky whitespace-only comments could make it to the database. Turns out, AI is just as prone to the &amp;quot;client-side validation is enough&amp;quot; fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Claude-generated setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s what our AI pair programmer came up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;-- Create comments table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comments (
    uid UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    feedback_uid UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES feedback(uid),
    outseta_person_uid VARCHAR NOT NULL DEFAULT auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;sub&apos;,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- Create policy to allow users to create comments
CREATE POLICY &amp;quot;Users can create comments&amp;quot;
    ON comments FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;sub&apos; = outseta_person_uid);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;const handleSubmit = async (event) =&amp;gt; {
  event.preventDefault();

  // Client-side validation courtesy of Claude
  if (!content.trim()) {
    setError(&amp;quot;Comments cannot be empty. Please add some text.&amp;quot;);
    return;
  }

  // Submit to Supabase
  const { error } = await supabase.from(&amp;quot;comments&amp;quot;).insert({
    feedback_uid: feedbackUid,
    content,
  });

  if (error) {
    setError(error.message);
    return;
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the AI made sure the content is &lt;code&gt;NOT NULL&lt;/code&gt; and even added the &lt;code&gt;.trim()&lt;/code&gt; check before submitting to Supabase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After stream I took a closer look and realized whitespace-only comments could make it to the database if someone wanted to be sneaky doing something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct API calls to Supabase using something like Postman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser console manipulation to skip the validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or in the future (if this was not merely a demo project) we could have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other front-ends that don&apos;t implement the same validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dev removing the validation for some reason&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI removing the validation while working on another feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therfore the general rule of the World Wide Web is to never-ever trust data coming from a client to be correct or valid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using Supabase adding a similar &amp;quot;trim&amp;quot; check at the database level is a good place to put your server-side validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I added this constraint to the table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;ALTER TABLE comments
ADD CONSTRAINT non_empty_content
CHECK (TRIM(BOTH FROM content) &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &apos;&apos;::text);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to insert a whitespace-only comment after adding this constraint I got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ERROR: new row for relation &amp;quot;comments&amp;quot; violates check constraint &amp;quot;non_empty_content&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect! The database now rejects these problematic comments regardless of where they come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are working on a new project and want to add this constraint from the start, you may add it as part of your table creation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;-- Create comments table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comments (
    uid UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    content TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (TRIM(BOTH FROM content) &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &apos;&apos;::text),
    feedback_uid UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES feedback(uid),
    outseta_person_uid VARCHAR NOT NULL DEFAULT auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;sub&apos;,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other tech stacks it might make more sense to do this in an API layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI generated code is trained on human code, so the same typical mistakes are made!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement validation at every layer, but always on the server side!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TRIM(BOTH FROM content) &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &apos;&apos;::text&lt;/code&gt; is your friend for text content validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s see if we can get Claude to add the constraint from the start next time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@QueenRaae/live&quot;&gt;Monday 26th May at 15:30 CEST&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;new row violates row-level security policy for table &amp;quot;vote&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😩😩😩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s hope this article saves you some time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had configured two separate policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;-- For viewing active votes
CREATE POLICY &amp;quot;Anyone can view active votes&amp;quot;
  ON vote FOR SELECT
  USING (deleted_at IS NULL);

-- For updating votes
CREATE POLICY &amp;quot;Users can update their votes&amp;quot;
  ON vote FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;sub&apos; = outseta_person_uid)
  WITH CHECK (auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;sub&apos; = outseta_person_uid);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my (still beginners) mental model of RLS, the &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; policy would only be used when updating the vote, and the &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; policy would be used when selecting the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I googled, and found some intersting new knowleged by reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpolicy.html&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Typically an &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; command also needs to read data from columns in the relation being updated (e.g., in a &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause or a &lt;code&gt;RETURNING&lt;/code&gt; clause, or in an expression on the right hand side of the &lt;code&gt;SET&lt;/code&gt; clause). In this case, &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; rights are also required on the relation being updated, and the appropriate &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ALL&lt;/code&gt; policies will be applied in addition to the &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; policies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in other words: &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE operations implicitly require SELECT access to the rows being modified&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the user did in fact have &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; permissions on the vote as when initating the update, &lt;code&gt;deleted_at&lt;/code&gt; value was NULL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why was the update failing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😠😠😠&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much googling and head scratching, and testing it seems like &lt;strong&gt;SELECT policies must be valid BOTH before AND after an UPDATE operation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not succeeded in finding any documentation on this, but numerous posts on Stack Overflow and Github issues seem to suggest this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Claude gave me this explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL requires SELECT policies to be valid both before and after an UPDATE operation to maintain transactional consistency. This ensures you can always see the results of your own modifications and prevents situations where rows would &apos;disappear&apos; mid-transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to get a more authoritative source on this, if you have one, please let me know (queen@raae.codes)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution in my case was to change the SELECT policy to allow anyone to see active votes and all their votes regardless of status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;-- Modified SELECT policy to see your own votes regardless of deleted status
CREATE POLICY &amp;quot;Users can view their votes&amp;quot;
  ON vote FOR SELECT
  USING (deleted_at IS NULL OR auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;sub&apos; = outseta_person_uid);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy combines two visibility rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone can see active votes (where &lt;code&gt;deleted_at IS NULL&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users can always see their votes (where &lt;code&gt;auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;sub&apos; = outseta_person_uid&lt;/code&gt;), regardless of deletion status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete Feedback Fort code is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/outseta/outseta-supabase-react-feedback-fort&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RLS is easy to get started with, but also easy to mess up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the docs 🤪&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more to the point of this article, remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UPDATE operations first need to SELECT the rows they&apos;ll modify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After an UPDATE, you must still have SELECT access to the modified row&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I was pretty sure it was possible, but it took me some time to come up with the solution. I realised it could be used with any JWT-based auth provider, so I thought I&apos;d share the solution here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;aside class=&amp;quot;notice&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve also created a full &lt;a href=&quot;https://outseta-supabase-react-feedback-fort.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;React + Supabase + Outseta demo app&lt;/a&gt; that you can use as a starting point for your own project. Full source code is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/outseta/outseta-supabase-react-feedback-fort&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have an existing authentication system that issues JWTs, but you want to leverage Supabase&apos;s Row Level Security (RLS) features that expect Supabase-signed tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchange your authentication provider&apos;s JWT for a Supabase-signed JWT, then use the latter for all Supabase operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The token exchange must happen server-side and follows these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify the original JWT&lt;/strong&gt; using your auth provider&apos;s public key or JWKS endpoint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a new JWT&lt;/strong&gt; with additional claims required by Supabase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign the new JWT&lt;/strong&gt; with your Supabase JWT Secret&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the Supabase-signed JWT&lt;/strong&gt; in subsequent requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Set Up Your Authentication Provider&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And take note of the shape for the JWT payload they provide, typical it will include things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt;: The unique ID of the authenticated user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;: User&apos;s email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;: User&apos;s name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org_id&lt;/code&gt;: User&apos;s organisation ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.outseta.com/support/kb/articles/XQYMXqQP/the-jwt-access-token?utm_source=queen&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=supabase-exchange&quot;&gt;Outseta JWT docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Create an Exchange Function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploy a server-side function that handles the token exchange. This can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Supabase Edge Function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An API route in your application server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A serverless function somewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll use a Supabase Edge Function for this example, but the same principles apply to any server-side function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll need the following environment variables for the Edge Function (found in Supabase Console under Edge Functions -&amp;gt; Secrets):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET&lt;/code&gt;: Your Supabase JWT secret (found in the Supabase Console under Project Settings -&amp;gt; Data API)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;AUTH_JWKS_URL&lt;/code&gt;: The JWKS URL for your auth provider (found in the auth provider&apos;s docs)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or &lt;code&gt;AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY&lt;/code&gt;: The public key for your auth provider (found in the auth provider&apos;s docs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy the function, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;supabase functions deploy exchange --no-verify-jwt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or upload the function from the Supabase Console making sure to disable the &amp;quot;Enforce JWT Verification&amp;quot; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--no-verify-jwt&lt;/code&gt; flag is essential because this endpoint is requested with the JWTs from your external auth provider, not a Supabase-signed tokens. Without this flag, Supabase would automatically reject these requests as it would try to verify them as Supabase JWTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a sample exchange function using Supabase Edge Functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;// File: /functions/exchange/index.ts
// Deploy with: supabase functions deploy exchange --no-verify-jwt

import * as jose from &amp;quot;https://deno.land/x/jose@v4.14.4/index.ts&amp;quot;;

const corsHeaders = {
  &amp;quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;authorization, x-client-info, apikey, content-type&amp;quot;,
};

Deno.serve(async (req) =&amp;gt; {
  if (req.method === &amp;quot;OPTIONS&amp;quot;) {
    return new Response(&amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;, { headers: corsHeaders });
  }

  // Get the original JWT from the Authorization header
  const authHeader = req.headers.get(&amp;quot;Authorization&amp;quot;);
  const originalJwt = authHeader?.split(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)[1] || &amp;quot;&amp;quot;;

  try {
    // OPTION 1: Verify with JWKS URL
    const JWKS = jose.createRemoteJWKSet(new URL(Deno.env.get(&amp;quot;AUTH_JWKS_URL&amp;quot;)));

    // OPTION 2: Verify with public key
    // const publicKey = await jose.importSPKI(Deno.env.get(&amp;quot;AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;RS256&amp;quot;);

    // Verify the token
    const { payload } = await jose.jwtVerify(originalJwt, JWKS);

    // Add the required role claim if not already present for a valid Supabase JWT
    payload.role = &amp;quot;authenticated&amp;quot;; // Required by Supabase

    // Add or modify any other claims you need for RLS policies
    // payload.some_claim = &amp;quot;some claim&amp;quot;;

    // Sign with Supabase JWT secret
    const supabaseSecret = new TextEncoder().encode(Deno.env.get(&amp;quot;SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET&amp;quot;));

    const supabaseJwt = await new jose.SignJWT(payload)
      .setProtectedHeader({ alg: &amp;quot;HS256&amp;quot;, typ: &amp;quot;JWT&amp;quot; })
      .setIssuer(&amp;quot;supabase&amp;quot;)
      .setIssuedAt(payload.iat)
      .setExpirationTime(payload.exp || &amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
      .sign(supabaseSecret);

    // Return the Supabase JWT
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ supabaseJwt }), {
      headers: { ...corsHeaders, &amp;quot;Content-Type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;application/json&amp;quot; },
      status: 200,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(&amp;quot;JWT verification failed:&amp;quot;, error.message);
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: &amp;quot;Invalid token&amp;quot; }), {
      headers: { ...corsHeaders, &amp;quot;Content-Type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;application/json&amp;quot; },
      status: 401,
    });
  }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Use the Exchanged JWT with Supabase Client&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most elegant way to use the exchanged JWT is to configure the Supabase client with a custom accessToken handler that automatically exchanges tokens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;import { createClient } from &amp;quot;@supabase/supabase-js&amp;quot;;

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

// Create Supabase client with automatic token exchange
export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  accessToken: async (fallbackToken) =&amp;gt; {
    // Get the original JWT from your auth provider
    const originalJwt = getAuthProviderToken(); // Replace with your auth provider&apos;s method

    if (!originalJwt) {
      return null; // No token available
    }

    // Exchange it for a Supabase token
    const supabaseJwt = await exchangeToken(originalJwt);
    return supabaseJwt || fallbackToken;
  },
});

// Function to exchange the original JWT for a Supabase JWT
async function exchangeToken(originalJwt) {
  // Perhaps add some caching here to avoid unnecessary exchanges,
  // only need to exchange if originalJwt has changed
  try {
    console.log(&amp;quot;Exchanging token for Supabase access&amp;quot;);
    const response = await fetch(`${supabaseUrl}/functions/v1/exchange`, {
      method: &amp;quot;POST&amp;quot;,
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${originalJwt}`,
        &amp;quot;Content-Type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;application/json&amp;quot;,
      },
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Token exchange failed: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const { supabaseJwt } = await response.json();
    return supabaseJwt;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(&amp;quot;Error exchanging token:&amp;quot;, error);
    return null;
  }
}

// Example usage - just use the supabase client normally!
// The token exchange happens automatically behind the scenes
const { data, error } = await supabase.from(&amp;quot;my_table&amp;quot;).select(&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating RLS Policies with the Exchanged JWT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supabase makes the decoded JWT available in RLS policies through the built-in &lt;code&gt;auth.jwt()&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;-- Example: Only allow users to read their own records
CREATE POLICY &amp;quot;Users can read their own data&amp;quot; ON my_table
  FOR SELECT
  -- Using auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;sub&apos;instead of auth.uid() as you could with Supabase auth
  USING (auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;sub&apos; = user_id);

-- Example: Organization-based access if you have an org_id claim
CREATE POLICY &amp;quot;Users can access organization data&amp;quot; ON org_resources
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;org_id&apos; = organization_id);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting Default Values from JWT Claims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use JWT claims as default values for table columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;-- Example: Automatically set the user_id when a record is created
ALTER TABLE my_table
  ALTER COLUMN user_id SET DEFAULT auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;sub&apos;;

-- Example: Set organization_id from JWT claim
ALTER TABLE org_resources
  ALTER COLUMN organization_id SET DEFAULT auth.jwt() -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &apos;org_id&apos;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: Always verify the original JWT on the server side before exchanging it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claims Mapping&lt;/strong&gt;: Transfer all relevant claims from the original JWT to the Supabase JWT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expiration&lt;/strong&gt;: Preserve the original token&apos;s expiration time in the Supabase token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error Handling&lt;/strong&gt;: Handle verification failures gracefully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By implementing this token exchange pattern, you can continue using your existing authentication system while taking full advantage of Supabase&apos;s powerful RLS capabilities. This approach gives you the flexibility to use any JWT-based auth provider that does not have a built-in Supabase integration, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://outseta.com/?via=queen&amp;amp;utm_source=queen&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=supabase-exchange&quot;&gt;Outseta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy building! 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on a thing for work. I need this arrow to ALWAYS be inline with the text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a screenshot simular to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./problem.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of an arrow on the next line after the title&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many creative solition from the group, but for this problem I like to reach for the newish css text wrap option &lt;code&gt;balance&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSS Solution&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;h2 {
  text-wrap: balance;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tailwind Solution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2 class=&amp;quot;text-balance&amp;quot;&amp;gt;...long title that will break...&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;balance&lt;/code&gt; tells the browser to make each line as equal in width as possible, resulting in no single word or arrow left on a line by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./fix.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of an arrow on the next line together with parts of the title&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the icon must be inline with the text in the HTML for this to work. If you are using an svg for instance make sure to set it&apos;s display property to &lt;code&gt;inline-block&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with the newly released &lt;a href=&quot;https://framer.link/queen-raae&quot;&gt;Framer&lt;/a&gt; Forms I needed a quick way to check exactly what was sent to the webhook and remembered a tool I&apos;ve used before: &lt;a href=&quot;https://webhook.site/&quot;&gt;Webhook.site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll design the site in &lt;a href=&quot;https://framer.link/queen-raae&quot;&gt;Framer&lt;/a&gt;, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://outseta.com/?via=queen&quot;&gt;Outseta&lt;/a&gt; for authentication and protection of members-only content, and stitch it all together with Framer&apos;s Code Overrides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature we tackled today was to show a different post-item variant based on the link to the post. We&apos;ll configure &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.outseta.com/support/kb/categories/rQVZLeQ6/protected-content&quot;&gt;Outseta to protect&lt;/a&gt; all pages starting with &amp;quot;/posts/locked-&amp;quot; from unauthenticated visitors, so it makes sense to use the same mechanism for selecting the &amp;quot;locked&amp;quot; design of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./primary-locked.png&quot; alt=&quot;Primary and Locked variants&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Code Override&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Code Override checks if the link of the post starts with &amp;quot;/posts/locked-&amp;quot;. If the link does, it selects the &amp;quot;locked&amp;quot; variant, and if not it selects the &amp;quot;primary&amp;quot; variant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;export function withCorrectVariant(Component): ComponentType {
  return (props) =&amp;gt; {
    const { link } = props;
    const variant = link.startsWith(&amp;quot;/posts/locked-&amp;quot;) ? &amp;quot;Locked&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;Primary&amp;quot;;
    return &amp;lt;Component {...props} variant={variant} /&amp;gt;;
  };
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Code Override name is not my best work, please help me out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40raae%20a%20better%20name%20would%20be&quot;&gt;suggesting a better name&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotcha: the &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; property is the pathname sans domain to the, and it starts with a &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The items linking to pages starting with &amp;quot;/posts/locked-&amp;quot; now show the &amp;quot;locked&amp;quot; variant and the rest show the &amp;quot;primary&amp;quot; variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./the-result.png&quot; alt=&quot;Primary and Locked post items with demo content&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending Framer functionality with Code Overrides is such a superpower, especially if you are someone who can spell variant right on the first try...I cannot as becomes evident if you watch the full stream on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/s0eXaQr26Xs?si=_ToBcXuhKtfP72G2&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also watch us figure this approach out &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/live/yTNr3Y1xGbU&quot;&gt;live on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adding the &amp;quot;most popular&amp;quot; episodes section to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/olavea/Our-podcast-websites&quot;&gt;our Astro podcast website&lt;/a&gt; the local DX took a nose dive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the home page took 3789ms, that&apos;s almost 4 seconds 🤦‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fetching all the analytics data from the Transistor API, looping through and calculating the total download numbers for each episode, and then sorting the episodes by popularity takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could probably optimize the code, but it would still slow down the build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could skip picking out the most popular episodes in development, but then it be hard to design that section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And neither would solve the issue that fetching the data from the Transistor API also needs to happen in the single episode page template (&lt;code&gt;/src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro&lt;/code&gt;) and the paginated archive pages (&lt;code&gt;/src/pages/episodes/[...page].astro&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I really missed the Gatsby Data Layer 😢 I deep-dived into the Astro Collection docs hoping I&apos;d missed the option to source remote data as an Astro Collection. I had not, but I did notice Astro collection can be of type &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;, meaning .json or .yml files in addition to type &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; meaning .md, .mdx and .markdoc files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to explore fetching all the data, and calculating the total download numbers, ahead of time! Writing the response from the Transistor API as .json files to disk; one for each episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;import { join } from &amp;quot;node:path&amp;quot;;
import { writeFile } from &amp;quot;node:fs/promises&amp;quot;;
import { fetchAllEpisodes, fetchAllEpisodeAnalytics } from &amp;quot;./transistor.js&amp;quot;;

try {
  const DIR = join(process.cwd() + &amp;quot;/src/content/episodes/&amp;quot;);

  const episodeData = await fetchAllEpisodes();
  const episodeAnalytics = await fetchAllEpisodeAnalytics();

  const episodeFilePromises = episodeData.map((episode) =&amp;gt; {
    const analytics = episodeAnalytics.attributes.episodes.find((a) =&amp;gt; {
      return parseInt(a.id) === parseInt(episode.id);
    });

    const totalDownloads = analytics.downloads.reduce(
      (acc, day) =&amp;gt; acc + day.downloads,
      0
    );

    return writeFile(
      join(DIR + `/${episode.id}.json`),
      JSON.stringify(
        {
          ...episode.attributes,
          totalDownloads,
        },
        null,
        2
      )
    );
  });

  const files = await Promise.all(episodeFilePromises);
  console.log(`Episode entries written ${files.length} to ${DIR}.`);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And holy moly, it worked!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Build time for the home page went from 3789ms to 148ms 🎉🎉🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the build time improvement, I also got the added benefit of Astro&apos;s built-in collection validation. I decided to skip typescript for the data fetching code above, and rather rely on the collection schema to catch any errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;import { defineCollection, z } from &amp;quot;astro:content&amp;quot;;

const episodeCollection = defineCollection({
  type: &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;,
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    slug: z.string(),
    totalDownloads: z.number(),
    description: z.string(),
    embed_html: z.string(),
    // and more as we build out the site
  }),
});

export const collections = {
  episodes: episodeCollection,
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gut feeling is that we&apos;ll see support for remote collection in Astro pretty soon, but for now, I&apos;m happy with the solution I&apos;ve come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

And there is still time for you to sign up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you need some added accountability. We could set up co-working sessions 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick Something to Build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build it in 2 Weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules and Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t overthink it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t start until March 1, 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can build anything. Write an ebook. Design a UI library. Build a web application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of 2 weeks, ship what you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m building a, Astro website for our podcast Data in the Wild launching in April now that all episodes of season 1 are recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I plan on &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/QueenRaae/live&quot;&gt;live streaming&lt;/a&gt; every day starting Monday, the 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I fold or skip some, that is also okay...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👷‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many users?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many transactions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many uploads?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a company with all of the Norwegian population (5.4 million) as its possible customer base will never get close to what an Amazon or a Spotify would need in terms of scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked, &amp;quot;How many customers are we talking about scaling to in the next three years, best case?&amp;quot; in a meeting this week, the answer was 900.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;900 customers with no uploads, posts, or multiple transactions per customer, and all traffic to the site is coming from within Norway. Maybe not all; someone might log in while on vacation. But you get my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the buzzwords are void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need for replications of edge functions across the globe, no need to handle 1000s of simultaneous requests, no need for real-time SDK, and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In it, she mentioned that the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v18.2.0&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; release was in June 2022 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made me peek at the release note again, reminding me that React Server Components (RSC) are still experimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And together with experiences like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time a new developer picked up our codebase, the questions came up: “What’s running on the server? What’s running on the client?” Every PR had feedback regarding something accidentally/unnecessarily shipped to the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mux.com/blog/what-are-react-server-components&quot;&gt;​Everything I Wish I Knew before moving 50,000 lines of code to React Server Components​&lt;/a&gt; it makes me cautious, very cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&apos;s always a good idea to try to understand a concept, and for that, I recommend Josh Comeau&apos;s post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/server-components/&quot;&gt;Making Sense of React Server Components&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few new (and some deprecated) elements since the last time I did any intentional research on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drip Campaigns:&lt;/strong&gt; Platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://userlist.com/&quot;&gt;Userlist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://convertkit.com/&quot;&gt;ConvertKit&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://outseta.com/?via=queen&quot;&gt;Outseta&lt;/a&gt; offer capabilities to set up drip campaigns with delays you may trigger from your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cron job:&lt;/strong&gt; Set up a cron job (for Node, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/node-cron/node-cron&quot;&gt;node-cron&lt;/a&gt;) to periodically check the time since the event and send an email through providers such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://resend.com/&quot;&gt;Resend&lt;/a&gt; when the elapsed time hits 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Queues:&lt;/strong&gt; Last but not least, you may use a queue solution with delay capabilities like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rabbitmq.com/&quot;&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inngest.com/&quot;&gt;Inngest&lt;/a&gt; with SendGrid, Resend etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All pointing toward the end of summer in the northern hemisphere, and maybe even the end of Gatsby?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FredKSchott/status/1693007599803752638?s=20&quot;&gt;FredKSchott&lt;/a&gt; (co-creator of Astro - kinda biased fella come to think of it) stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wardpeet/status/1693014604694061194&quot;&gt;wardpeet&lt;/a&gt;, former tech lead at Gatsby, answered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Gatsby is dead&amp;quot; sentiment spread like wildflowers in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Netlify followed up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Netlify/status/1694035000734216263&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./twitter.com_Netlify.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fear not! Gatsby is vital to a great many of our customers. Updates to React 18 and Gatsby Adapters are the most imminent updates, but we’re also busy investing in platform primitives for a stronger Gatsby.js (and other frameworks too).&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do know is that Gatsby Cloud will be shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all Gatsby Cloud Free plan customers, your Gatsby Cloud instance will be discontinued on September 29, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know that Gatsby powers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/blog/framework-popularity-on-netlify/&quot;&gt;19% of Netlify&apos;s enterprise customers&lt;/a&gt; - enterprise is where the money&apos;s at! Twitter-devs making blogs and portfolios, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer, Netlify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/blog/gatsby-adapters-realize-the-full-potential-of-gatsby-on-your-platform/&quot;&gt;shipped adaptors&lt;/a&gt;, making it possible for any hosting provider to run full-featured Gatsby sites. Before acquiring Gatsby, Netlify had to reverse engineer SSR, DSR, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still hopeful that we&apos;ll see Gatsby evolve, but I&apos;ll be looking into Astro while also spending some more time tinkering with good old Node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totally feel the vibe of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/flaviocopes/status/1695421873117438152&quot;&gt;this post doing its rounds on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    console.warn(&amp;quot;Could not save UTM params to session storage&amp;quot;);

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The try block is essential because turning off cookies in a browser also disables session storage as it can be used for the same purposes (tracking people) as you see here. So you want to make sure you handle that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, if you add this script to every page, the values will be overridden by empty strings on subsequent page visits. Therefore we add that if statement to ensure we have all the values we expect a visitor landing on a page from our campaign to have. Make sure to tweak this to your use case!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search, or query params, is the information after the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; in a URL such as &lt;code&gt;utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_medium=paid_social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=summer_sale&lt;/code&gt; in our example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTM is a set of params commonly used for tracking marketing efforts, but you can add anything here to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some quick googling and came over many creative solutions like separating out the search params by splitting on &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, vanilla JS supports this use case out of the box 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const url = new URL(
  &amp;quot;https://example.com?utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_medium=paid_social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=summer_sale&amp;quot;
);

console.log(
  url.searchParams.get(&amp;quot;utm_source&amp;quot;),
  url.searchParams.get(&amp;quot;utm_medium&amp;quot;),
  url.searchParams.get(&amp;quot;utm_campaign&amp;quot;)
);

// Output: facebook paid_social summer_sale
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022-05-10-new-url/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;URL&lt;/code&gt; is the constructor&lt;/a&gt; you should reach for every time you deal with URLs, and the &lt;code&gt;searchParams&lt;/code&gt; we are accessing here conforms to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;URLSearchParams&lt;/code&gt; interface with methods such as &lt;code&gt;has&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getAll&lt;/code&gt; and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never try to deal with URLs yourself; JS got your back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll also need to keep the values arround in &lt;a href=&quot;/2023-05-11-session-storage/&quot;&gt;session storage&lt;/a&gt; to make use of them later.&lt;/p&gt;

Luckily &lt;em&gt;half moon&lt;/em&gt; was watching and let me know I needed to use PUT, not POST for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/ZNhD4pXZOhI?feature=share&amp;amp;t=2506&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screenshot-put-post.png&quot; alt=&quot;It need to be PUT, not POST&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using PUT is technically the correct use of the HTTP methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp&quot;&gt;W3Schools&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not what my favorite API in the whole wide world, the Stripe API and many others, does. Stripe use POST for both creation and updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST /v1/customers
POST /v1/customers/:id
&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp&quot;&gt;Stripe API Docs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once burned, I always double-check, which saved us when using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outseta.com?via=queen&quot;&gt;Outseta&lt;/a&gt; API on yesterday&apos;s rum-fueled treasure hunt. The Outseta API also uses PUT for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is your reminder to double-check that HTTP Method before pursuing other explanations for failing updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as I did, the opportunity of a lifetime came along. I am joining &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outseta.com?via=queen&quot;&gt;Outseta&lt;/a&gt;, the all-in-one membership software, as a fractional Developer Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll be earning a salary and equity per Outseta&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outseta.com/posts/payment-structure&quot;&gt;unique approach to compensation and ownership&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you not always been in Developer Relations? You might ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many folks assumed I worked for Gatsby in some Developer Relations capacity. I did not 😆&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we created Prune your Follows in public in partnership with Xata and are now producing a podcast for them. So you could say it&apos;s been written in the stars for a few months now, and accepting the position unlocked this memory for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1646417559967629313&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./tweet_memory.png&quot; alt=&quot;September 2018, I finished the sentence: &amp;quot;In five years I&apos;ll be&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;a Developer Advocate&amp;quot; for my uni reunion. Then life, side projects, and becoming a Gatsby authority happened. But here we are four and a half years later, and I am Outseta&apos;s fractional Developer Advocate 🎉&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while it hasn&apos;t felt intentional, who knows how these things fall into place 🤷‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;

One part of me wants to head to the mountains with &amp;quot;everyone else,&amp;quot; and another simply wants to enjoy a silent and eerie Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out it&apos;s not an either-or conundrum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to spend the first weekend of this easter holiday at a friend&apos;s cabin, while we&apos;ll spend the rest of the week back home in Oslo. Hoping to make it a tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./easter-skiing.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The family in a sea of white snow and sunlight&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you ask, and the universe answers, or maybe you just got clear on what you wanted and made it happen 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with every school holiday, no content outside this email. Therefore no schedule!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your country celebrate easter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free $0 / mo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic $100 / mo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise $42,000 / mo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free does not give us access to who a user follows, so Prune your Follows would need the Basic-tier. We can find a way to cover the $100, but Basic only lets us facilitate five unfollows per 15 minutes per user. That is 10% of the current limit of 50 unfollows per 15 minutes per user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my question to you is; would Prune you Follows still be helpful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

It doesn&apos;t look so good with random broken images when demoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for the broken images is that it&apos;s been a while since I imported these accounts. So folks have changed their profile image, and some have left the platform. Instead of reimporting the roughly 5000 accounts I follow, I removed the ones with a broken image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, I used probe-image-size because it throws an error when the image probed is unavailable. Meaning my code would be super tidy without me writing a helper function. I&apos;ve used it before to probe for an image&apos;s size, the actual use case, when doing Gatsby Image CDN stuff, as it needs to know the size of the original image, and sometimes all you have is an URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the task at hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ Get all account records&lt;br&gt;
2️⃣ Probe each account profile image&lt;br&gt;
3️⃣ Delete the account record if the image is unavailable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// 1️⃣ Get account records
let page = await xata.db.accounts
  .select([&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;username&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;meta.profile_image_url&amp;quot;])
  .getPaginated({
    pagination: {
      size: 20,
    },
  });

const deleteBrokenImage = async (record) =&amp;gt; {
  try {
    // 2️⃣ Probe each account profile image
    await probe(record.meta.profile_image_url);
    console.log(&amp;quot;Do not delete &amp;quot;, record.username);
  } catch (error) {
    // 3️⃣ Delete the account record if the image is unavailable
    await xata.db.accounts.delete(record.id);
    console.log(&amp;quot;Deleted &amp;quot;, record.username);
  }
};

await Promise.all(page.records.map(deleteBrokenImage));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve skipped pagination, so the example code will only go through the first 20 records. For the following 20 records and so forth, you&apos;d need to do &lt;code&gt;await page.nextPage()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the complete code, look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/xata-search-three-ways-demo/blob/main/src/api/clean.js&quot;&gt;demo code on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciated the part of her talk where she showed her process—even some drawings from kindergarten. It very visually drove home that it takes practice and creative side quests to end up with a project like hers—something we all need to be reminded of every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think it might be a helpful feature for Prune you Follows. Either the user selects an account, or we look at already unfollowed accounts and suggest new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/VrpOFeWbz5M?feature=share&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Pirate Princess holding two small stuffed animals with Cap&apos;n&apos;, Queen Raae and Milly+Tilly Cam&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s promising, but when looking for similar accounts to the Tailwind founder Adam, we&apos;re not really looking for others named Adam 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./adam-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;Results for Adam, lots of Adams&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, there is important info in the account name, especially for accounts representing non-humans, such as the Tailwind account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./tailwind-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;Results for Tailwind, lots of other ui frameworks&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Adam case might be because he has an undetailed description. His co-founder Steve does not give us as many Steves...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./steve-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;Results for Steve&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this exploration, we used embeddings created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings&quot;&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; from the input:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const input = `
    Name: ${account.name};
    Username: ${account.username};
    Location: ${account.meta.location};
    Description: ${account.meta.description};
    Followers: ${account.public_metrics.followers_count};
    Following: ${account.public_metrics.following_count};
`;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a data point of view, embeddings are simply arrays of floats. They are the output of ML models, where the input can be a word, a sentence, a paragraph of text, an image, an audio file, a video file, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each number in the array of floats represents the input text on a particular dimension, which depends on the model. This means that the more similar the embeddings are, the more &amp;quot;similar&amp;quot; the input objects are. I&apos;ve put &amp;quot;similar&amp;quot; in quotes because it depends on the model what kind of similar it means. When it comes to text, it&apos;s usually about &amp;quot;similar in meaning&amp;quot;, even if different words, expressions, or languages are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to style the &lt;code&gt;mark&lt;/code&gt; element in the possibly highlighted search result?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out Tailwind has support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#using-arbitrary-variants&quot;&gt;Using arbitrary variants&lt;/a&gt;, but it took me quite a while to find that in the documentation, I&apos;ll tell you 🕵️‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;const HighlighetResult = () =&amp;gt; {
  return (
    &amp;lt;span
      className=&amp;quot;[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;em]:bg-amber-300&amp;quot; // 👈👈👈
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
        __html: highlight?.username || record.username,
      }}
    /&amp;gt;
  );
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; in the code example, you may use any regular old css selector! So, for instance, if you are getting content from a third party, you could do &lt;code&gt;[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;p]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;img]&lt;/code&gt; etc. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; indicates direct descendant; for any &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; you&apos;ll need to do &lt;code&gt;[&amp;amp;_img], the &lt;/code&gt;_` will be read as a space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./higlighting.png&quot; alt=&quot;The resulting styled highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the difference better, I created a demo comparing it to the other two search options Xata provides: full-text search with fuzzy matching and partial plaintext search using &amp;quot;contains&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for &amp;quot;norway&amp;quot; all three gives us results for accounts mentioning &amp;quot;norway&amp;quot; in some way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./norway.png&quot; alt=&quot;A search for &amp;quot;norway&amp;quot; gives results for all three types of search&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when searching for &amp;quot;norwegians&amp;quot; we can see where Semantic Search shines. @nynorskdama does not mention &amp;quot;norwegian&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;norway&amp;quot;, but semantically &amp;quot;norsk&amp;quot; is the same as &amp;quot;norwegian&amp;quot; in Norwegian 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./norwegians.png&quot; alt=&quot;A search for &amp;quot;norwegians&amp;quot; gives results for all but plaintext type of search&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might also know that &amp;quot;Ulsteinvik&amp;quot; is geography part of Norway and thus semantically close to &amp;quot;norwegians&amp;quot; as is the case when searching for &amp;quot;valdres&amp;quot; - a location in Norway and it gives us accounts located other places in Norway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./valdres.png&quot; alt=&quot;A search for &amp;quot;valdres&amp;quot; gives results only for semantic stype of search&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a great rundown of how to get started and the article I used to kick start my journey, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Swizec&quot;&gt;Swizec&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://swizec.com/blog/build-semantic-search-in-an-afternoon-yep/&quot;&gt;Build semantic search in an afternoon? Yep 🤯&lt;/a&gt; even if it took me longer than an afternoon 😬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to use what I have learned to explore &lt;a href=&quot;/2023-03-25-similar-accounts&quot;&gt;a similar accounts feature&lt;/a&gt; for Prune your Follows on this week&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/PmbSFeDzg0U&quot;&gt;unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica&apos;s product Affilimate gives you actionable insight into the affiliate links on your site. And they started with the assumption that one organization would only own one website. Later, of course, they had to remodel that to an array of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside of modeling a thing as an array right off the bat is minimal while migrating to an array later on, is quite the ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Monica was modeling users and roles, she made sure a user could inhabit multiple roles and that a role could consist of multiple scopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did this by attempting to format the number 25000 into something a little more readable. All of the surrounding text is English, so it feels correct to use &amp;quot;en&amp;quot; as the locale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const number = 25000;
number.toLocaleString(&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;);
// Result 25,000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the result did not look good to me, so I did a quick and dirty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const number = 25000;
number.toLocaleString(&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;).replace(&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;);
// Result 25 000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screenshot-numbers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Showcasing 25490 formatted as 25 490&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, after the stream, I got convinced it might just be my sensible Norwegian eyes not handling something so unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1631377391816671232&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./tweet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Plot twist: She changed her mind based on a Twitter convo 😮 Behold the comma that jar my Norwegian eyes!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think space, how bad would it be to make it happen by forcing Norwegian formatting using &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; as the locale?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const number = 25000;
number.toLocaleString(&amp;quot;no&amp;quot;);
// Result 25 000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descript is &lt;code&gt;descript&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;brew install descript
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Password is &lt;code&gt;1password&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;brew install 1password
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But VSCode is &lt;code&gt;visual-studio-code&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;brew install visual-studio-code`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Homebrew saves you so much time! You no longer need to find the download button on each site, wait for the download, and then drag the icon to the Applications folder. Fire and forget!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite features of Xata is the built-in &amp;quot;fuzzy search&amp;quot; functionality. Most database solutions let you search for an exact match. Users these days, though, often expect a more forgiving search, one that will match &amp;quot;olso&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;oslo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;alez&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;alex&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuzzy search to the rescue! 💪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./xata-fuzzy-search-on-off.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The difference in results with fuzzy search enabled and disabled&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;➡️ Read all of &lt;a href=&quot;https://xata.io/blog/how-to-fuzzy-search-with-xata&quot;&gt;How to Fuzzy Search With Xata&lt;/a&gt; on the Xata blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// File: src/pages/example.js
export function Head() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;html lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Hello World&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;
  );
}

export default function ExamplePage() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello World&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are coming from Helmet, this is the exact syntax you know and probably love. Unfortunately, this was not possible when Gatsby introduced v4.19 (July 2022 #2), as I experienced &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-09-06-head-lang/&quot;&gt;the hard way&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there was not much to react to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid plan: 100 USD a month with
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for low level of API usage (whatever that means)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;max 1,500 tweets created per month&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./twitter.com_TwitterDev.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Twitter Dev&apos;s update&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have no idea if Prune your Follows can run on the free plan. 100 USD a month is a lot to swing for a side project such as Prune your Follows if that is where we land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s all cross our fingers that we&apos;ll be fine on the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; free plan 🤞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up being super confused by the size requirements, but 1200 x 630px seems to be the holy grail of these images. The size works across Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if I am wrong, please!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both LinkedIn and Facebook require a meta tag with &lt;code&gt;property&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;og-image&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta property=&amp;quot;og:image&amp;quot; content={imageUrl} /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Twitter requires a meta tag with &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;twitter:image&lt;/code&gt; in addition to information about the style of the &amp;quot;sharing card&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;twitter:card&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;summary_large_image&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Together we will build the future of composable, and empower developers with flexibility and choice in building composable web experiences.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is I talked about JavaScript framework business models with pirate @tujoworker when meeting him in real life earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tujoworker/status/1620827519757979651&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./twitter.com_raae.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wow, and I just talked today with @raae about JavaScript framework business models ✨&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me they are betting on Valhalla. Still, they also promise to be &amp;quot;good stewards of the Gatsby open-source project and the maintainers will join the open source group together with the creators of frameworks like Solid JS and Eleventy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Wrong meta tags might not be &amp;quot;visible&amp;quot; for days since Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. heavily cache this data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily they all have tools to check if it&apos;s all correct without you having to make an actual post. These tools also help force the service in question to bust its cache, grabbing the data from the latest version of your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/inspect/https:%2F%2Fqueen.raae.codes&quot;&gt;LinkedIn Post Inspector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fqueen.raae.codes&quot;&gt;Facebook Sharing Debugger&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit the &amp;quot;scrape again&amp;quot; to bust the cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator&quot;&gt;Twitter Card Validator&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No longer shows a preview, but will bust the cache (we think)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another quick way to ensure it&apos;s all correct is using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialsharepreview.com/browser-extensions&quot;&gt;Social Share Preview&lt;/a&gt; Chrome Extension. It will not bust any caches, so make sure to head over to the tools above when you are done with your changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

And back in November, &lt;code&gt;node-canvas&lt;/code&gt; did not have Node v18 support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now it does, and the upgrade was pretty swift for me 🥳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran the &lt;code&gt;gatsby-codemods&lt;/code&gt; to fix &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/#graphql-schema-changes-to-sort-and-aggregation-fields&quot;&gt;GraphQL schema: Changes to sort and aggregation fields&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;npx gatsby-codemods@latest sort-and-aggr-graphql .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I also had to refactor from &lt;code&gt;nodeModel.runQuery&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;nodeModel.getAllNodes&lt;/code&gt; in my &amp;quot;find related content&amp;quot; resolver inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://reckoning.dev/blog/related-posts-gatsbyjs/&quot;&gt;How to Create List of Related Content in Gatsby.JS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But alas, when moving to a Xata Worker, the cookie set by NextAuth is unavailable as the Worker is served from another domain. However, the &lt;code&gt;getToken&lt;/code&gt; function can also get the token from the `Authorization: &apos;Bearer token&apos;. But how do we make that happen 🤷‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1616165782123069459&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./tweet.png&quot; alt=&quot;That feeling when you realise on stream that your cookie + JWT knowledge is not as solid as you thought...well it will become solid!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll figure it out over the next few weeks! I am sure 💪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat this, we think that some type of queuing architecture is needed. Feel free to reply if you have any input!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we decided to explore Xata Workers on this week&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/O89C_yxZK3o&quot;&gt;unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; as Xata Workers is built on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers&quot;&gt;Cloudflare Workers&lt;/a&gt; and Cloudflare also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare Queues&lt;/a&gt; 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/O89C_yxZK3o&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab of stream with crazy looking Captain Ola and funny looking Pirate Princess&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/O89C_yxZK3o?t=1558&quot;&gt;we did get a Worker working&lt;/a&gt; locally while on stream 🥳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we did not handle authenticating the user inside our Xata Worker. Needed to make sure the user has access and only gets relevant records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pirate Shai to the rescue; hopefully, time will tell...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shaisc/status/1613679030494023682&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./twitter.com_shaisc.png&quot; alt=&quot;getToken() is a shortcut wrapper that uses process.env, which doesn&apos;t exist in the Xata Worker, but you can instead use decode() directly and pass it the token (from request.headers) and secret (from env) yourself&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We initialized Xata Workers in our exiting Xata project &lt;code&gt;xata workers init&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;defined a Xata Worker, copy/past-ing the code from our Gatsby Function,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and then used the defined Worker directly in our &lt;code&gt;useQuery&lt;/code&gt; replacing the GET request to &lt;code&gt;/api/account&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xata CLI will magically cut out the Xata Worker code and deploy it to Cloudflare for us, using &lt;code&gt;xata upload&lt;/code&gt; 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For local development, we used &lt;code&gt;xata workers watch&lt;/code&gt;. Not completly sure what happens then 😬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;import { useQuery } from &amp;quot;@tanstack/react-query&amp;quot;;
import { useUser } from &amp;quot;../user&amp;quot;;

import { xataWorker } from &amp;quot;./../../xata&amp;quot;;

// Define Xata Worker 1️⃣
const searchAccount = xataWorker(
  &amp;quot;searchAccount&amp;quot;,
  async ({ xata }, { search }) =&amp;gt; {
    const searchResults = await xata.search.all(search, {
      tables: [
        {
          table: &amp;quot;accounts&amp;quot;,
          target: [
            { column: &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;, weight: 3 },
            { column: &amp;quot;username&amp;quot;, weight: 7 },
            { column: &amp;quot;meta.location&amp;quot; },
            { column: &amp;quot;meta.description&amp;quot; },
          ],
        },
      ],
      highlight: { enabled: true },
      fuzziness: 1,
      prefix: &amp;quot;phrase&amp;quot;,
    });

    const records = searchResults.map((result) =&amp;gt; {
      return {
        ...result,
        searchInfo: result.record.getMetadata(),
      };
    });

    return { records };
  }
);

export default function useSearch({ search }) {
  const { data: user } = useUser();

  return useQuery(
    [&amp;quot;accounts&amp;quot;, user?.id, &amp;quot;search&amp;quot;, search],
    async () =&amp;gt; {
      // Use the Xata Worker 2️⃣
      return searchAccount({ search: search });
    },
    {
      enabled: Boolean(user?.enableQueries) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Boolean(search),
      keepPreviousData: true,
    }
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, this code is incomplete, as we need to filter the accounts by the authenticated user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://queen.raae.codes/emails/reminders/&quot;&gt;email reminder&lt;/a&gt; to ensure you catch the next stream, where we&apos;ll try to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.usefathom.com/share/lfdkntld/pruneyourfollows.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./tech-crunch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tech Crunch Traffic&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤦‍♀️ We do not track the signup dates, so I cannot give you a pretty graph of the signups. However, I followed the numbers of users in the database pretty closely during both events, and the traffic peaks corresponded to a spike in new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note to self for next time:&lt;/strong&gt; Either make sure to track signup dates or, better yet, use a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://logsnag.com/&quot;&gt;LogSnag&lt;/a&gt;, and I&apos;d have a pretty graph to show out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;820 users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13.767 unfollows facilitated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;308 emails collected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.usefathom.com/share/difbaeot/queen.raae.codes&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./referrer-traffic.png&quot; alt=&quot;Traffic coming from Google, Twitter, pruneyourfollows.com, techcrunch.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do not have access to Xata&apos;s analytics. We could always ask them for an update every now and then. But it would be nicer to keep an eye on this ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, I finally finished up this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-fathom/issues/2&quot;&gt;year-old Pull Request&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;code&gt;trackGoal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;trackPageview&lt;/code&gt; support in @raae/gatsby-plugin-fathom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ola added goal tracking to &lt;em&gt;all the links&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;br&gt;
And showed us how on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/SftxLYjW_ZQ&quot;&gt;week&apos;s rum-fueled treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; 🏴‍☠️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to use @raae/gatsby-plugin-fathom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create events for the links you would like to track in your Fathom Dashboard 1️⃣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade to the latest version of the plugin: &lt;code&gt;yarn add @raae/gatsby-plugin-fathom@latest&lt;/code&gt; 2️⃣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import &lt;code&gt;useFathom&lt;/code&gt; from @raae/gatsby-plugin-fathom 3️⃣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destruct &lt;code&gt;trackGoal&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;useFathom&lt;/code&gt; hook 4️⃣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track clicks using the correct Event ID 5️⃣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { useFathom } from &amp;quot;@raae/gatsby-plugin-fathom&amp;quot;; // 3️⃣

export function Footer() {
  const { trackGoal } = useFathom(); // 4️⃣
  return (
    &amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;
      Powered by{&amp;quot; &amp;quot;}
      &amp;lt;a
        onClick={() =&amp;gt; {
          trackGoal(&amp;quot;GEVKO638&amp;quot;, 0); // 5️⃣
        }}
        href=&amp;quot;https://xata.io/&amp;quot;
      &amp;gt;
        Xata
      &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

</content:encoded></item><item><title>📝 ✨ ~ Have you checked your Referrer-Policy?</title><link>https://queen.raae.codes/2023-01-05-referrer-policy/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://queen.raae.codes/2023-01-05-referrer-policy/</guid><description>Prune your follows initial build was sponsored by Xata.

As part of the agreement, the site has a &amp;quot;powered by Xata&amp;quot; notice on every page linking to &lt;a href=&quot;https://xata.io/&quot;&gt;xata.io&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to a link to my site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at my our analytics, I found it weird that no one was clicking through from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/&quot;&gt;pruneyourfollows.com&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://queen.raae.codes/&quot;&gt;queen.raae.codes&lt;/a&gt; or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I imagine tracking traffic from PYF is part of Xata&apos;s evaluation of our collab, I got a little worried 😬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out the default Referrer-Policy is &lt;code&gt;same-origin&lt;/code&gt; for Gatsby Cloud, Netlify, and probably most other similar platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;same-origin&lt;/code&gt;: Send the origin, path, and query string for same-origin requests. Don&apos;t send the Referer header for cross-origin requests.
&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy&quot;&gt;mdn web docs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only referrals tracked on for example, queen.raae.codes, were from itself to itself 🤦‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/referrer-best-practices&quot;&gt;Referer and Referrer-Policy best practices&lt;/a&gt; from web.dev I landed on using &lt;code&gt;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will send along the origin (&lt;code&gt;https://pruneyourfollows.com&lt;/code&gt;) but not the full URL (&lt;code&gt;https://pruneyourfollows.com/app?example=possible-secret&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to set the Referrer-Policy on Gatsby Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make &lt;code&gt;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&lt;/code&gt; the policy across the board configure the &lt;code&gt;gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud&lt;/code&gt; like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud`,
      options: {
        headers: {
          &amp;quot;/*&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin&amp;quot;],
        },
      },
    },
  ],
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And voila, I finally saw referrer information from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/&quot;&gt;pruneyourfollows.com&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://queen.raae.codes/&quot;&gt;queen.raae.codes&lt;/a&gt; and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.usefathom.com/share/lfdkntld/pruneyourfollows.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;referrer-policy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fathom analytics dashboard for Prune your follows&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. Since we do not have access to Xata&apos;s analytics, we would also like to track clicks on their link on our side, and we&apos;ll do that on tonight&apos;s treasure hunt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SftxLYjW_ZQ&quot;&gt;Track outgoing links with Fathom for Prune your follows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/app/filter/unpopular&quot;&gt;/app/filter/unpopular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/app/filter/unfollowed&quot;&gt;/app/filter/unfollowed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/app/filter/unpopular&quot;&gt;/app/filter/unpopular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for most filters, there are more than 60 accounts, so we added pagination by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capturing the page number using the Gatsby File System Route API 1️⃣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extending the React Query cache key with the page number 2️⃣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculating an offset using the page number 3️⃣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passing along the offset with our query for filtered accounts 4️⃣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// ./src/pages/app/filter/[filter]/[...page].js 👈👈👈 1️⃣

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import axios from &amp;quot;axios&amp;quot;;
import { useQuery } from &amp;quot;@tanstack/react-query&amp;quot;;

export default function SearchPage(props) {
  const pageIndex = parseInt(props.page) || 0;
  const size = 60;
  const offset = pageIndex * size; //👈👈👈 3️⃣
  const { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: [&amp;quot;accounts&amp;quot;, props.filter, props.page], // 👈👈👈 2️⃣
    queryFn: ({ signal }) =&amp;gt;
      axios.get(&amp;quot;/api/accounts&amp;quot;, {
        params: {
          size: size,
          filter: props.filter,
          offset: offset, //👈👈👈 4️⃣
        },
        signal: signal,
      }),
    select: (result) =&amp;gt; result.data,
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
      {(data?.records || []).map((record) =&amp;gt; (
        &amp;lt;li key={record.accountId}&amp;gt;
          {record.name} @{record.username}
        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      ))}
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &amp;quot;capturing the page number using the Gatsby File System Route API&amp;quot; made no sense, then &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-12-01-url-based-pagination/&quot;&gt;Url-based (client-side) pagination with Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in awe of all the support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/&quot;&gt;Prune your Follows&lt;/a&gt;, and I guess us 🥰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch went so well that Twitter was not having it. After just a couple of hours, Prune your Follows had facilitated over 500 unfollows, and Twitter cut off our access 😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving most users of Prune your Follows this experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./alert.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alert for most users asking them to come back tomorrow&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, we claimed the 13th spot on Product Hunt that day 💪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having an annoyed user help rewrite the alert &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1603492853585436706?s=20&amp;amp;t=aBPK5fBpomRgAqcmiZz26g&quot;&gt;to something positive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The 80+ comments on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/prune-your-follows&quot;&gt;Product Hunt launch page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several folks loving PYF and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1603331684052733952?s=20&amp;amp;t=aBPK5fBpomRgAqcmiZz26g&quot;&gt;asking for new features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100+ new users on the day and another 100+ users over the weekend&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week we launched Prune your Follows!&lt;br&gt;
It was a blast, we broke the internet (kind of), and I&apos;ll tell you more about it tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Pirate Princess is out of school (Thursday 22nd to January 2nd), we&apos;ll take a break from all regularly scheduled content. The streams might even wait another couple of weeks to get started in the new year. We have five family birthdays in 5 weeks, including mine 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023 would you like more of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;follow along as we build a real app&amp;quot; content,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;this is how things are done in Gatsby&amp;quot; content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or something else, maybe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.3/&quot;&gt;Gatsby 5.3&lt;/a&gt; came out five days ago, giving us &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.3/#es-modules-esm-in-gatsby-files&quot;&gt;ES Modules (ESM) in Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; files. Finally 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our streaming schedule this week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None, it&apos;s Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other events this week&lt;/h2&gt;

The Why…</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On this week&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/qAyaQaPIQCA&quot;&gt;unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby we added we added usage stats to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/&quot;&gt;Prune your Follows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./social-proof-section.png&quot; alt=&quot;Social proof section&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s one way to show &amp;quot;social proof&amp;quot;. Other ways are testimonials, reviews, the little avatars that are also present in the screenshot above, and more. Its purpose: Show potential users that it will be okay. Loads of people have already trusted us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ We queried Xata, our serverless database, for aggregated data,&lt;br&gt;
2️⃣ created a Gatsby data node to hold the information,&lt;br&gt;
3️⃣ and used a static Gatsby query to get hold of the information in our component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: /.gatsby-node.js

exports.sourceNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { reporter, actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode } = actions;

  // 1️⃣ Query Xata
  const result = await xata.db.accounts.aggregate({
    unfollowsTotal: {
      count: {
        filter: {
          //There is some older test data in there
          unfollowed: { $ge: new Date(&amp;quot;2022-11-03&amp;quot;) },
        },
      },
    },
    usersTotal: {
      uniqueCount: {
        column: &amp;quot;followed_by&amp;quot;,
      },
    },
  });

  const statsData = {
    unfollowedCount: result.aggs.unfollowsTotal,
    userCount: result.aggs.usersTotal,
  };

  // 2️⃣ Create Node
  createNode({
    id: createNodeId(&amp;quot;statistics&amp;quot;),
    ...statsData,
    internal: {
      type: &amp;quot;Statistics&amp;quot;,
      contentDigest: createContentDigest(statsData),
    },
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// File: ./src/domain/marketing/Stat.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from &amp;quot;gatsby&amp;quot;;

export function Stats() {
  // 3️⃣ Use in component
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      statistics {
        unfollowedCount
        userCount
      }
    }
  `);

  return (
    &amp;lt;section&amp;gt;
      Users: {data.statistics.userCount}
      Unfollows: {data.statistics.unfollowedCount}
    &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the pull request for the complete example, including the tailwind design for the component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Queen Raae and family worked on several projects for Xata.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contrary to popular belief, Queen Raae and family have never worked for Gatsby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>📝 ✨ ~ Launch day ~ we need your help</title><link>https://queen.raae.codes/2022-12-15-lauch-day/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://queen.raae.codes/2022-12-15-lauch-day/</guid><description>The time has come, and with your help, we might get Prune your Follows into the coveted top 10 on Product Hunt 🚀 Prune your Follows is currently at #14, maybe…</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The time has come, and with your help, we might get Prune your Follows into the coveted top 10 on Product Hunt 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prune your Follows is currently at #14, maybe you&apos;re upvote is the one that makes all the difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;➡️ Upvote (and perhaps even comment) on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/prune-your-follows-a-twitter-tool&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; ​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the way, you don&apos;t have to be a Twitter user to upvote, even though Prune your Follows is a Twitter tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are on Twitter, we&apos;d love a like, retweet and/or quote tweet of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1603305950131224576?s=20&amp;amp;t=Ig5SMc_1qQjyBjLI8xdFng&quot;&gt;announcement tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Prune you follows is powered by the serverless database &lt;a href=&quot;https://xata.io/&quot;&gt;Xata&lt;/a&gt; and is our first foray into sponsored build-in-public projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week was not the best. The whole family came down with something (🤧), giving you an unscheduled break from my emails and our streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily we still managed to celebrate my badass mom, and former CTO, who turned 63 this weekend 🥳&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are still planning on launching &lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/&quot;&gt;Prune your Follows&lt;/a&gt; this week. On Thursday, to be exact, it would be extra special if you managed to give us an upvote within the first hours. That would be 09:00-10:00 CET or 12:00-01:00 AM PST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hitting some interesting Twitter limits, and we&apos;ll need to convey that in the UI before the launch so folks don&apos;t get unexplainable failures when unfollowing. I will make it happen in time 😬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xata is running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xata/status/1600186056942489600?s=20&amp;amp;t=HReA7KG8l53LPhrLOsqBZA&quot;&gt;Christmas Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to participate and need any help, let us know!&lt;/p&gt;

So for &lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com&quot;&gt;Prune your follows&lt;/a&gt;, we already had an URL structure for filters like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/app/filter/unpopular&quot;&gt;/app/filter/unpopular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/app/filter/unfollowed&quot;&gt;/app/filter/unfollowed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/app/filter/unpopular&quot;&gt;/app/filter/unpopular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the selected filter in the URL makes all the use cases mentioned above possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/#creating-client-only-routes&quot;&gt;Gatsby File System Route API&lt;/a&gt; does the heavy lifting for us, automagically surfacing the selected filter as a page prop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// File: ./src/pages/app/filter/[...filter].js 👈👈👈

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export default function FilterPage(props) {
  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your selected filter is {props.params.filter}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      {/* OR */}
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your selected filter is {props.filter}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path &lt;code&gt;/app/filter/unfollowed&lt;/code&gt; in the above example prints out &amp;quot;Your selected filter is unfollowed&amp;quot; twice as I wanted to show that the selected filter is available both in &lt;code&gt;props.filter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;props.params.filter&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For pagination, we need to add another level in our file system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// ./src/pages/app/filter/[filter]/[...page].js 👈👈👈

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export default function FilterPage(props) {
  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        Your selected filter is {props.filter}, &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
        and your selected page is {props.page}
      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/app/filter/unpopular&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Your selected filter is unpopular, and your selected page is&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/app/filter/overactive/3&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Your selected filter is overactive, and your selected page is 3&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW: These values are strings (or undefined), so it might be a good idea to convert the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;pageIndex&lt;/code&gt; right away and add a sensible default:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// ./src/pages/app/filter/[filter]/[...page].js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export default function FilterPage(props) {
  const pageIndex = props.page ? parseInt(props.page) : 0; 👈👈👈
  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        Your selected filter is {props.filter} &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
        and your selected page is {pageIndex}
      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/app/filter/unpopular&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Your selected filter is unpopular, and your selected page is 0&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week is about improving &lt;a href=&quot;https://pruneyourfollows.com/&quot;&gt;pruneyourfollows.com&lt;/a&gt; and wrapping up our work on the Cloudinary plugins with reworked documentation 📝&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.1/&quot;&gt;v5.1.0&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still haven&apos;t had time to play with Partial Hydration, but we did play with slices on steam. I even clipped what we did into a shorter video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/mLXJ6dXXwww&quot;&gt;How to use the Gatsby v5 Slices API with Josh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I even talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-slice/&quot;&gt;Slices API&lt;/a&gt; unlocks up to 90% reduction in build duration for content changes in highly shared components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/performance/partial-hydration/&quot;&gt;Partial Hydration&lt;/a&gt; allows you to ship only the necessary JavaScript to the browser&lt;/li&gt;

The app does not import data for unfollowed accounts; at some point, the imported image avatars break, and it look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./broken-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;Broken image looking bad&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shai Schechter to the rescue! He climbed onboard for Friday&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/7FiUfiyJXt8&quot;&gt;unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands to help us out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screen-dump.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screendump of stream&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He proposed listing for the image&apos;s load and error events to determine its status. It also meant we could add a nice pulsating style while loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;import clsx from &amp;quot;clsx&amp;quot;;
import React, { useState } from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export function Avatar({ imageUrl, altText, className }) {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState(&amp;quot;loading&amp;quot;);

  const handleOnLoad = () =&amp;gt; {
    setStatus(&amp;quot;fulfilled&amp;quot;);
  };

  const handleOnError = () =&amp;gt; {
    setStatus(&amp;quot;failed&amp;quot;);
  };

  return (
    &amp;lt;div
      className={clsx(
        &amp;quot;overflow-hidden rounded-full border bg-slate-400&amp;quot;,
        status === &amp;quot;loading&amp;quot; ? &amp;quot;animate-pulse&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;&amp;quot;,
        className
      )}
    &amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;img
        className={clsx(
          status === &amp;quot;fulfilled&amp;quot; ? &amp;quot;visible&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;w-full&amp;quot;
        )}
        src={imageUrl}
        alt={altText}
        onLoad={handleOnLoad}
        onError={handleOnError}
      /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I set it up as &lt;code&gt;status === &amp;quot;failed&amp;quot; ? &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;visible&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; (flipped logic) to begin with, but that resulted in a flicker of a broken image and, to be honest, hiding until success makes much more sense!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some plugins will need changes to handle Gatsby v5&apos;s breaking changes. They are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/#handling-breaking-changes&quot;&gt;all listed&lt;/a&gt; in the migration v4 to v5 migration docs. The ones most probable to break your plugin are probably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/#graphql-schema-changes-to-sort-and-aggregation-fields&quot;&gt;GraphQL schema: Changes to sort and aggregation fields&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/#removal-of-nodemodelrunquery-and-nodemodelgetallnodes&quot;&gt;Removal of nodeModel.runQuery and nodeModel.getAllNodes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-let-it-snow&quot;&gt;@raae/gatsby-plugin-let-it-snow&lt;/a&gt; required no changes, but I made su❄️re to upgrade the demo to v5 and add v5 as a possible peer dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no reason not to add some snow to your Gatsby v5 experiments this season!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still can&apos;t wrap my head around what @GatsbyJS Valhalla is. I get the part where it&apos;s supposed to unify multiple content sources but couldn&apos;t you do that with normal gatsby-node.js? Is it a GUI? Is it a concept/approach to work? an npm package?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In answer, I replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s what you see when you open the graphiql explorer, but as a stand alone product to be used by any framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not had time to play around with it yet. But I am very excited about what Valhalla might do for the plugin ecosystem. If they succeed, I hope it encourages CMS and other services to up their Gatsby source and transformer game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-md&quot;&gt;⭐️ Star the repository on Github\
🐦 Tweet about the plugin, and make sure to tag @cloudinary\
👩‍💻 Create content about the plugin and let @cloudinary know on Twitter\
✍️ Refer to the plugin in your project&apos;s readme
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on the docs for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary&quot;&gt;gatsby-source-cloudinary&lt;/a&gt; today, I again encountered the problem with using &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; (i.e. double space) at the end of a line to indicate a line break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, VSCode removes trailing whitespace. I disabled this setting at one point, but Ola still has the default setting. Whenever he worked on the docs the line breaks disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is not something we can solve with Prettier, and asking every contributor to disable the setting is not really feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did some Googling, and what do you know: You can use &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;, problem solved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1587128677724291074&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./Halloween-Tailwind-Tweet-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;🥳 Big milestone today — Tailwind CSS turns 5 years old! We released the very first version of Tailwind CSS on Halloween night in 2017 👻 (Special thanks to @mattwalerdotcom for this amazingly relevant photo 🎃&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are you with these two?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/PCQrzSE33Y4&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./twitter-screendump.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab from the show&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we create an interactive feature like that, we are squarely in the middle of Client Side Rendering (CSR) land. We don&apos;t want the page to reload when the user clicks or taps the unfollow button. We want to let the user keep going about their business while the server tries to fulfill the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when someone clicks or taps the unfollow button in Prune your Follows:
Our client (a rehydrated Gatsby site) asks our server (a Gatsby Function) to unfollow the account.
Our Gatsby Function asks Twitter to unfollow the account in question.
Twitter responds.
Our Gatsby Function asks Xata to update the corresponding account record.
Xata responds.
Our Gatsby Function responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./unfollow-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Unfollow Diagram&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;song and dance&amp;quot; is done again and again for all the different functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the fuzzy search functionality we added last week. There is no need to talk Twitter, though, as all the accounts are periodically imported into the Xata database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./search-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search Diagram&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were relying on Server Side Rendering, the same song and dance would be happening. But the response from our server would be an entire web page, not just a little piece of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same song and dance would also be happening with Server Side Components. But the response would be a component the framework knows how to stitch into the current web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1584783104199344129?s=20&amp;amp;t=O4JOz8g7ZWYaiBr3TatYRg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./twitter-fuzzy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of explainer video&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descript makes it so easy you might get sick of me posting videos to Twitter 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1584879912116056064?s=20&amp;amp;t=O4JOz8g7ZWYaiBr3TatYRg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./twitter-videos.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Asking for a friend&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descript transcribes your videos. Then you may use the transcription as your text overlay like I have added above my head in the example above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even cooler! You can edit the video by editing the transcription. It makes it much easier to remove parts and rearrange your sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./descript.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of the Descript interface&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that very beneficial when creating clips of me answering questions on the stream. It seems I often start with some background and then arrive at my answer. However, the other way around works much better for the short clip version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

Is my talk ready? NO&lt;br&gt;
Will it be ready? YES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some discount codes; let me know if you want one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Macbook is getting old; lately, the battery has gone from bad to worse. Then the trackpad stopped working correctly. So to make sure it does not die, on stage, I took it to the iHospital, and now it no longer has a swollen battery 🥳&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xata.io/&quot;&gt;Xata&lt;/a&gt; has search built-in. Even fuzzy search! Something that makes a dyslectic like me very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuzzy search allows spelling errors by setting a fuzziness level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;aside class=&amp;quot;notice&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuzziness Level:&lt;/strong&gt; Maximum &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance&quot;&gt;Levenshtein distance&lt;/a&gt; for the search terms. The Levenshtein distance is the number of one-character changes needed to make two strings equal. The default is 1, meaning that single-character typos per word are tolerated by search. You can set it to 0 to remove the typo tolerance or set it to 2 to allow two typos in a word.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Xata docs.&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On stream, we didn&apos;t manage to highlight the matches. We did think it was probably possible. And we were right! A Xata engineer reached out after the stream and told us how 🥳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1583443888169025538&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./twitter-fuzzy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Highlighting Celebration Tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// Function user in server-side code,
// in our case by a Gatsby Serverless Function

export const searchFollowing = async ({ followerId, sort, search }) =&amp;gt; {
  const results = await xata.search.all(search, {
    tables: [
      {
        table: &amp;quot;accounts&amp;quot;,
        target: [
          { column: &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;, weight: 7 },
          { column: &amp;quot;username&amp;quot;, weight: 7 },
          { column: &amp;quot;meta.location&amp;quot; },
          { column: &amp;quot;meta.description&amp;quot; },
        ],
        filter: { followed_by: followerId },
      },
    ],
    highlight: { enabled: true },
    fuzziness: 1,
    prefix: &amp;quot;phrase&amp;quot;,
  });

  return results.map((result) =&amp;gt; {
    return {
      ...result,
      searchInfo: result.record.getMetadata(),
    };
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results returned from the above function 👇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;// Removed surplus properties for brevity
[
  {
    &amp;quot;table&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;accounts&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;record&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Xata 🦋 Think Data, not Databases&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;username&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;xata&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;followed_by&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;4092141&amp;quot;
    },
    &amp;quot;searchInfo&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;highlight&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;followed_by&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;4092141&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;quot;],
        &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Xata&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; 🦋 Think &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Data&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, not Databases&amp;quot;],
        &amp;quot;username&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;xata&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;quot;]
      },
      &amp;quot;score&amp;quot;: 40.357788,
      &amp;quot;table&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;accounts&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;version&amp;quot;: 15
    }
  },
  {
    // And more results
  }
]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we can use the highlight property to create highlighted results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the complete code, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/prune-your-follows/pull/19&quot;&gt;Prune your Follows repository on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; Xata is sponsoring our rework of Prune your Follows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SlowSteadyPod/status/1582627389950988288?s=20&amp;amp;t=frrX5_RPqFJmSR-UvMm-5A&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./twitter.com_SlowSteadyPod.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of audiogram tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this week, I realized the denormalization I was doing for Prune your Follows is not really needed. No worries if the Twitter account info repeats for each app user following that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;aside class=&amp;quot;notice&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prune your Follows lets you import and filter everyone you follow on Twitter to find accounts to unfollow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of two tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;account
  - id
  - username
  - name
  - a lot more

follows
  - account
  - followed_by
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can go with one table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;account
  - id
  - username
  - name
  - followed_by
  - a lot more
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing it the denormalized way, we skip all kinds of complexity that comes with joining tables. For instance, it made it much easier to add the search functionality we created on &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Xr-s0Hg_45w&quot;&gt;tonight&apos;s treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

It replied with &lt;code&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/code&gt;, but I was pretty confident the &lt;code&gt;accessToken&lt;/code&gt; was correct. What could it be? I double, tripled checked my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I turned to my frenemy Google and found the answer way down there in an old forum thread. I had probably not requested the correct scope when authenticating the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, the information is right there in plain sight in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/follows/api-reference/get-users-id-following&quot;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt; 🤦‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1582323947961401344&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./twitter_auth_scopes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tweet with image of the documentation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I set &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-09-09-nextauth/&quot;&gt;up the NextAuth with Gatsby integration weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, and their default scope settings have worked perfectly so far 😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To override NextAuth&apos;s default scope &lt;code&gt;authorization.params.scope&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;TwitterProvider&lt;/code&gt; configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;export const authConfig = {
  // Configure one or more authentication providers
  providers: [
    TwitterProvider({
      clientId: process.env.TWITTER_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET,
      version: &amp;quot;2.0&amp;quot;,
      // 👇👇👇
      authorization: {
        params: {
          scope: &amp;quot;users.read tweet.read follows.read&amp;quot;,
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you remember this when you need it or find it again when you need it. I&apos;ll probably google and land back on this myself the next time this happens to me 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for this week&apos;s unauthorized and rum-fueled &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Xr-s0Hg_45w&quot;&gt;treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, we&apos;ll be working on Prune your Follows using Xata, NextAuth, and Gatsby of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small news:&lt;/strong&gt; This weekend, my sister and I closed up the summer cabin, already looking forward to easter when we&apos;ll be back to paint the boat house 👩‍🎨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1581291213185245186?s=20&amp;amp;t=T-v5bJ2ppPcm1ST4YECe1g&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./twitter.com_raae.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View of Mollösund from the cabin&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gatsby news:&lt;/strong&gt; Last week, Gatsby released the v5 Beta. It requires React v18 and Node v18; kinda funny those two are the same version 🤪 To get started, look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://v5.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/&quot;&gt;Migrating from v4 to v5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear how you get on. I use node-canvas to generate open graph images, and somehow it does not support Node v18 yet, so no upgrading for me 😢 But I guess I could upgrade Prune your Follows 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/yDxF8FUNUbI&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;screengrab-show.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab from the show&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, we needed to add an external script. Since I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-01-05-external-scripts/&quot;&gt;Third party scripts with Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; back in January, Gatsby has added a new way: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-script/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Script&lt;/code&gt; component&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be used to add both inline scripts and external scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopscotch provides us with an inline script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script id=&amp;quot;hopscotch-script&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt;(function (w, d) {if (typeof w === &amp;quot;undefined&amp;quot;) return;w.Hopscotch = w.Hopscotch || function () {(w.Hopscotch.q = w.Hopscotch.q || []).push(arguments);};var elm = d.createElement(&amp;quot;div&amp;quot;);elm.setAttribute(&amp;quot;data-widget-host&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hopscotch&amp;quot;);elm.setAttribute(&amp;quot;data-props-api-key&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;39311cf6-d7b7-5e00-b8e7&amp;quot;);d.getElementsByTagName(&amp;quot;body&amp;quot;)[0].appendChild(elm);var s = d.createElement(&amp;quot;script&amp;quot;);s.src = &amp;quot;https://widgets.hopscotch.club/v1/widget.js?&amp;quot;;s.async = 1;s.defer = 1;d.getElementsByTagName(&amp;quot;body&amp;quot;)[0].appendChild(s);  })(window, document);&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it work as a &lt;code&gt;Script&lt;/code&gt; component, we had to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchange &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Script&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the inline code a &amp;quot;template literal&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Script
  id=&amp;quot;hopscotch-script&amp;quot;
  type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;{`(function (w, d) {if (typeof w === &amp;quot;undefined&amp;quot;) return;w.Hopscotch = w.Hopscotch || function () {(w.Hopscotch.q = w.Hopscotch.q || []).push(arguments);};var elm = d.createElement(&amp;quot;div&amp;quot;);elm.setAttribute(&amp;quot;data-widget-host&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hopscotch&amp;quot;);elm.setAttribute(&amp;quot;data-props-api-key&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;39311cf6-d7b7-5e00-b8e7&amp;quot;);d.getElementsByTagName(&amp;quot;body&amp;quot;)[0].appendChild(elm);var s = d.createElement(&amp;quot;script&amp;quot;);s.src = &amp;quot;https://widgets.hopscotch.club/v1/widget.js?&amp;quot;;s.async = 1;s.defer = 1;d.getElementsByTagName(&amp;quot;body&amp;quot;)[0].appendChild(s);  })(window, document);`}&amp;lt;/Script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we set up the tour in Hopscotch 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./product-tour.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab of product tour&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the whole thing took us less than 15 minutes, but we managed to stream for a full hour anyhow: chatting, testing things out, and meeting Cam&apos;s dog 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more about 24 Semantic HTML Elements this advent by signing up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://advent.raae.codes&quot;&gt;Semantic Advent&lt;/a&gt; that will run again in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semantic HTML is the foundation of a web project. It helps assistive technologies and Google make sense of your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is semantic HTML? &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;heading&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;aside&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;section&lt;/code&gt; etc. all have semantic meaning. It says something about the content inside them. If the content is a stand-alone piece of content, use &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt;; if it&apos;s a list, use &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. In comparison, &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; have no semantic meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lean more about check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/learn/html/semantic-html/&quot;&gt;web.dev&apos;s article on Semantic HTML&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, adherence to semantic HTML often gets lost when creating reusable React UI components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say we make a reusable card component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// File: card.js
import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export function Card(props) {
  const { children } = props;
  return &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;{children}&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense not to give the design of the content (a card) any semantic meaning by using a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;. However, such a component is very often used semantically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a list of blog posts =&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a call out in an article =&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;aside&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To spice up the design of a paragraph =&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can solve the issue by surrounding the card with the correct semantic element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// File: exmaple.js
import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { Card } from &amp;quot;./card&amp;quot;;

export function Example() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;article&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An introduction&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;aside&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;Card&amp;gt;
          Something related to the article but a little outside of the normal
          flow.
        &amp;lt;/Card&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More content...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;Card&amp;gt;A paragraph with different styling...&amp;lt;/Card&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More content...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we&apos;ll be notified that a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; is not a valid child of &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, and the approach feels iffy. At least to me 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The semantic HTML trick for React components!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;aside class=&amp;quot;notice&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was an error earlier in the example code caught by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/y19t4k/comment/irx1z7z/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&quot;&gt;GasimGasimzada on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; Thank you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; is a better prop name than &lt;code&gt;element&lt;/code&gt;, as suggested by several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/y19t4k/comment/irzwyr5/?context=3&quot;&gt;commentators on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the semantic HTML element configurable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// File: card.js
import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export function Card(props) {
  // 1️⃣ Destructure element and children from props
  const { element, children } = props;

  // 2️⃣ Capitalise element to make it valid jsx
  let Element = element;

  // 3️⃣ Make &amp;quot;div&amp;quot; the default choice
  if (!element) {
    Element = &amp;quot;div&amp;quot;;
  }

  return &amp;lt;Element&amp;gt;{children}&amp;lt;/Element&amp;gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in shorthand form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export function Card(props) {
  // Do 1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣ in one line
  const { element: Element = &amp;quot;div&amp;quot;, children } = props;

  return &amp;lt;Element&amp;gt;{children}&amp;lt;/Element&amp;gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may then use the Card component like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// File: exmaple.js
import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { Card } from &amp;quot;./card&amp;quot;;

export function Example() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;article&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An introduction&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      &amp;lt;Card element=&amp;quot;aside&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        Something related to the article but a little outside of the normal
        flow.
      &amp;lt;/Card&amp;gt;

      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More content...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      &amp;lt;Card element=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;A paragraph with different styling...&amp;lt;/Card&amp;gt;

      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More content...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit where credit is due. I learned how to do this by looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mui/material-ui&quot;&gt;MUI&apos;s source code&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lillian and I had an action-packed week of family fun in Heidelberg last week. But I also got some grown-up time with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mirjam_diala&quot;&gt;Mirjam&lt;/a&gt;, who you might know from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conferencebuddy.io/&quot;&gt;Conference Buddy&lt;/a&gt; streams last Christmas.

&lt;p&gt;Ola, on the other hand, went sailing again ⛵️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/F0Qs4NrSmBo&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stream Screendump&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xJ05H&quot;&gt;Josh Johnson&lt;/a&gt; from Gatsby, who works on Slices, joined us to talk pizza, slices, photography, and more. We also got to meet his &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xJ05H/status/1431021391617404934/photo/1&quot;&gt;dog Gilly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refactor the site header of queen.raae.codes into a Slice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Slices, every page rebuilds when the site header changes. With Slices, only the site header is rebuilt and stitched into place on every page, saving quite a lot of rebuilding time if you have complex pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OlaHolstVea/status/1576253338144079872&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;gatsby-slices-meme.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gatsby Slices Meme&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Slices to work, you register a component as a Slice using &lt;code&gt;createSlice&lt;/code&gt; in a similar way as creating pages manually using &lt;code&gt;createPage&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use a slice, you reach for the custom Gatsby &lt;code&gt;Slice&lt;/code&gt; component and pass it the name of your slice using the &lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt; prop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumer has is that down the line, you&apos;ll pop them in a slices folder, similarly to the pages folder 🤫&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: gatsby-node.js

exports.createPages = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { actions } = gatsbyUtils;

  actions.createSlice({
    id: `site-header`,
    component: require.resolve(`./src/components/site-header.js`),
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: src/pages/index.js
import { Slice } from &amp;quot;gatsby&amp;quot;;

export default function IndexPage() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;Slice alias=&amp;quot;site-header&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!-- Rest of the page --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For information on how to get started with plugin testing and how to use the &lt;code&gt;testPluginOptionsSchema&lt;/code&gt;, read &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-02-11-plugins-tests/&quot;&gt;Add tests to your Gatsby Plugin project ✅ 🧪&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when writing tests for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/blob/main/plugin/gatsby-node.test.js&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-cloudinary&lt;/a&gt; plugin this week, I realized it does not help with testing the default configuration or any other modifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily testing the &lt;code&gt;pluginSchemaOption&lt;/code&gt; without the help of &lt;code&gt;testPluginOptionsSchema&lt;/code&gt; was possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;import Joi from &amp;quot;joi&amp;quot;;
import { pluginOptionsSchema } from &amp;quot;./gatsby-node&amp;quot;;

describe(&amp;quot;pluginOptionsSchema&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; {
  test(&amp;quot;should add defaults&amp;quot;, async () =&amp;gt; {
    const schema = pluginOptionsSchema({ Joi });
    const options = {
      cloudName: &amp;quot;cloudName&amp;quot;,
      apiKey: &amp;quot;apiKey&amp;quot;,
      apiSecret: &amp;quot;apiSecret&amp;quot;,
      maxResults: 50,
    };
    const { value } = schema.validate(options);

    expect(value).toEqual({
      ...options,
      resourceType: &amp;quot;image&amp;quot;,
      maxResults: 50,
      resultsPerPage: 50,
      tags: false,
    });
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was extra important for this plugin as &lt;code&gt;resultsPerPage&lt;/code&gt;is actually dependent on &lt;code&gt;maxResults&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.6.1#refkey-options&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Joi.ref(&apos;maxResults&apos;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xJ05H&quot;&gt;Josh Johnson&lt;/a&gt; from Gatsby climbs onboard our unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, where we&apos;ll get to play around with the Slices API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week the Pirate Princess and I are headed for Germany for the fall holidays. So no stream, emails, nor podcast. But I&apos;ll get to meet my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slowandsteadypodcast.com/&quot;&gt;Slow &amp;amp; Steady Podcast&lt;/a&gt; co-host for the first time IRL 🥳&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/IicwkJCNy7k&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screendump of Ola, me, and Colby laughing with a blurry plush unicorn covering Lillian&apos;s face&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudinary is our client. This summer, we upgraded their plugins to work with v4, and these days we are working on an automated release process, &lt;code&gt;pluginOptionsSchema&lt;/code&gt; validation, clean-up of the documentation ++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a demo site to the gatsby-source-cloudinary repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a demo and the plugin code in the same repository makes setting up the dev environment a breeze. Even with automated tests in place, it&apos;s helpful to see the plugin in action as you develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/&quot;&gt;yarn workspaces&lt;/a&gt;. One workspace for the plugin and one for the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move the plugin code you already have into its own folder.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to call it &lt;code&gt;/plugin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then add the demo Gatsby site to another folder.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to call it &lt;code&gt;/demo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; in your root that looks like this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;private&amp;quot;: true,
  &amp;quot;workspaces&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;plugin&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;demo&amp;quot;],
  &amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;develop&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;yarn workspace demo develop&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;build&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;yarn workspace demo build&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;serve&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;yarn workspace demo serve&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;yarn workspace demo clean&amp;quot;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to delete whatever &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folders you might have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;yarn install&lt;/code&gt; from root&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any formatting or test scripts, I like to add those to the root &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; as well together with their local dev dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/pull/41&quot;&gt;Pull Request on Github&lt;/a&gt; for the full work on gatsby-source-cloudinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distribute Aid&apos;s mission is to provide for basic human needs at scale by connecting communities and empowering people to uphold human dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ended up being a long one as we completed the refactoring for all the page templates, including some extra work needed for the third one. However, we completed the first migration within the first 30 minutes of the stream if you want to watch how!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://distributeaid.org/&quot;&gt;Distribute Aid&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s Gatsby site from a page context to page query approach for getting data into their page templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing all data needed by a page through the page context works and is a straightforward solution I see many developers reach for. However, you then bypass Gatsby goodness, such as hot reloading and incremental builds, by removing the connection between a node and its page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of pushing through all data on the page context, pass only the node id. Then in the page template, use the node id to query for all data needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before migration: pushing all data on the page context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: gatsby-node.js
const path = require(&amp;quot;path&amp;quot;);

exports.createPages = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { graphql, actions } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createPage } = actions;

  const regionsQuery = await graphql(
    `
      query RegionsQuery {
        regions: allDaRegion {
          nodes {
            slug
            name
            overview
            subregions {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `
  );

  regionsQuery.data.regions.nodes.forEach((region) =&amp;gt; {
    createPage({
      path: `/regions/${region.slug}`,
      component: path.resolve(`./src/templates/RegionPage.js`),
      context: {
        region: region,
      },
    });
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: src/templates/RegionPage.js
import { graphql } from &amp;quot;gatsby&amp;quot;;

const RegionPage = ({ pageContext: { region } }) =&amp;gt; {
  return &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;{JSON.stringify(region, null, 2)}&amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;;
};

export default RegionPage;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After migration, passing only the node id:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: gatsby-node.js
const path = require(&amp;quot;path&amp;quot;);

exports.createPages = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { graphql, actions } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createPage } = actions;

  const regionsQuery = await graphql(`
    query RegionsQuery {
      regions: allDaRegion {
        nodes {
          id
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  regionsQuery.data.regions.nodes.forEach((region) =&amp;gt; {
    createPage({
      path: `/regions/${region.slug}`,
      component: path.resolve(`./src/templates/RegionPage.js`),
      context: {
        id: region.id,
      },
    });
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: src/templates/RegionPage.js
import { graphql } from &amp;quot;gatsby&amp;quot;;

const RegionPage = ({ data: { region } }) =&amp;gt; {
  return &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;{JSON.stringify(region, null, 2)}&amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;;
};

export default RegionPage;

export const query = graphql`
  query ($id: String!) {
    region: daRegion(id: { eq: $id }) {
      name
      overview
      subregions {
        name
      }
    }
  }
`;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;Pull Request on Github&lt;/a&gt; to view the full refactor, as the example above is somewhat simplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/inezabonte&quot;&gt;Ineza&lt;/a&gt; came through and got us back on track with some swift googling 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/UWVsibCXBFg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screendump-ineza-comment.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;From a google search, I see some comments about using node v18 - comment by Ineza&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out neither NextAuth nor Gatsby polyfills &lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt;, but it can easily be solved using Node v18!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from Supabase Auth to &lt;a href=&quot;https://next-auth.js.org/&quot;&gt;NextAuth&lt;/a&gt; for our little side project &lt;a href=&quot;https://prune.raae.tech/&quot;&gt;Prune your follows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextAuth is truly open source with a bring your own database (BYOD) approach. But most importantly, in our case, let us get access to a user&apos;s Twitter Access Token so we can request on their behalf. Getting around some pretty aggressive request limits on the Twitter API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example&quot;&gt;Getting Started Docs&lt;/a&gt; with some minor differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you are using Node v18.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm use 18
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install NextAuth with the &lt;code&gt;ignore-engines&lt;/code&gt; flag. Using Node v18 is not officially supported yet, but it does work. Read more in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/4819&quot;&gt;NextAuth Issue on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add next-auth --ignore-engines
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the &lt;code&gt;[...nextauth].js&lt;/code&gt; file in &lt;code&gt;src/api/auth/&lt;/code&gt; and do a little magic to the request object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;export default async function handler(req, res) {
  req.query.nextauth = req.params.nextauth.split(&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;);
  return await NextAuth(req, res, authConfig);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, you are as good as gold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/prune-your-follows/pull/15&quot;&gt;Pull Request on Github&lt;/a&gt; to view the move from Supabase Auth to NextAuth. The next step is to bring our own database, or do it all without any storage 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outdated as of Gatsby v5.5 (January 2023 #2)!&lt;br&gt;
➡️ Read &lt;a href=&quot;/2023-02-13-gatsby-head-lang/&quot;&gt;How to set HTML lang with Gatsby in 2023&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week we migrated from React Helmet to the new Gatsby Head API on our &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-09-02-head-api/&quot;&gt;unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was surprisingly straightforward as my existing use of React Helmet used their newest style,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: src/components/page-head.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { Helmet } from &amp;quot;react-helmet&amp;quot;;

export default function PageHead(props) {
  const { location, title } = props;
  const canonical = `${siteUrl}${location.pathname}`;
  return (
    &amp;lt;Helmet&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;html lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;{title}&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;canonical&amp;quot; href={canonical} /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Helmet&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that is the same structure expected by the Gatsby Head API as well, just without the &lt;code&gt;Helmet&lt;/code&gt; wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: src/components/page-head.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export default function PageHead(props) {
  const { location, title } = props;
  const canonical = `${siteUrl}${location.pathname}`;
  return (
    &amp;lt;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;html lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; // Read below before copying this line!!!
      &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;{title}&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;canonical&amp;quot; href={canonical} /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: src/pages/example.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import PageHead from &amp;quot;../components/

export function Head(props) {
  return &amp;lt;PageHead {...props} /&amp;gt;;
}

export default function ExamplePage() {
  return &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Hello World&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with some tiny differences that I did not pick up on until I actually read the documentation a little more closely after the stream 🤦‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gatsby Head API only messes with the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; element, while ReactHelmet also lets you mess with the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning my use of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; above was silently ignored 😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the language attribute back in, I had to reach for the &lt;code&gt;onRenderBody&lt;/code&gt; lifecycle hook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: gatsby-ssr.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

export const onRenderBody = (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { setHtmlAttributes } = gatsbyUtils;

  setHtmlAttributes({ lang: &amp;quot;en&amp;quot; });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a &lt;code&gt;setBodyAttributes&lt;/code&gt; utils to use if your original use of React Helmet sets body attributes you would like to keep around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Zyeuj7I7A50&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screendump.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stream Screendump&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We migrated from React Helmet to the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-head/&quot;&gt;React Head API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s always nice to get rid of dependencies, and I have seen some very intermitted issues with missing meta tags on a few pages, as reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/&quot;&gt;ahrefs&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, that will be a thing of the past after the migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made sure to enable migrating one page at a time instead of migrating it all at once. Experience has taught me the perils of the latter approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we cloned the existing &lt;code&gt;SEO&lt;/code&gt; component, named it &lt;code&gt;PageHead,&lt;/code&gt; and replaced the &lt;code&gt;Helmet&lt;/code&gt; wrapper with a fragment &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then returned the new &lt;code&gt;PageHead&lt;/code&gt; component from the named export &lt;code&gt;Head&lt;/code&gt; in the page template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Head API asks you to export a named component called &lt;code&gt;Head.&lt;/code&gt; Similar to how Gatsby picks up the default export as the content to inject into the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element, the named export &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt; as the page query, it now also picks up the named export &lt;code&gt;Head&lt;/code&gt; as content to inject into the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: src/pages/{Email.slug}.js
import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { graphql, Link } from &amp;quot;gatsby&amp;quot;;
import PageHead from &amp;quot;../components/page-head&amp;quot;;
import EmailTemplate from &amp;quot;../components/email-template&amp;quot;;

export function Head({ data, ...props }) {
  const { title, description } = data.email || {};
  return (
    &amp;lt;PageHead
      {...props}
      meta={{
        title: title,
        description: description,
      }}
    /&amp;gt;
  );
}

export default function EmailPage({ data, ...props }) {
  return &amp;lt;EmailTemplate {...data.email} {...props} /&amp;gt;;
}

export const query = graphql`
  query EmailById($id: String!) {
    email(id: { eq: $id }) {
      // ... the query
    }
  }
`;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/raae/queen.raae.codes/pull/126&quot;&gt;Pull Request on Github&lt;/a&gt; to view the full refactor we did on stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Cannot query field &amp;quot;allUserAvatar&amp;quot; on type &amp;quot;Query&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;issue by &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-08-31-panic/&quot;&gt;stopping the build&lt;/a&gt; if no data is sourced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you often want to allow empty data queries. Maybe the blog posts are not written yet, or there are no images for the gallery yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, defining the expected schema will help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: gatsby-node.js

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) =&amp;gt; {
  const { createTypes } = actions;
  const typeDefs = `
    type UserAvatar implements Node {
      username: String!
      avatarUrl: String!
    }
  `;
  createTypes(typeDefs);
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GraphQL queries will longer fail 💪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When choosing this solution, you should remember to account for missing data in your components. It could be as simple as returning nothing when no data is available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;if (data.allUserAvatar.nodes.length === 0) return null;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the code changes made to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/prune-your-follows/commit/a1f88b8e667b60d28bb12475bde4475335968525&quot;&gt;Prune your follows on Github&lt;/a&gt; to allow for empty avatar data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be better to fail as fast as possible, and you may do so with &lt;code&gt;reporter.panic&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: gatsby-node.js

    .limit(20);

  if (error) {
    // 👇👇👇 Stops the build

      },
    });
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

If you haven&apos;t &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloggingfordevs.com/&quot;&gt;signed up for her free email course&lt;/a&gt; yet, you are in for a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I get to meet many more internet friends IRL before the year ends as I&apos;llI&apos;ll be speaking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamstack.org/conf/&quot;&gt;Jamstack Conf&lt;/a&gt; in San Fransisco and then at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modernfrontends.live/&quot;&gt;Modern Frontends&lt;/a&gt; in London 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby is hyping the Data Layer these days. Coincidently my favorite part of Gatsby, so I am all for that. I am eager to get my hands on &lt;em&gt;Runtime GraphQL&lt;/em&gt; for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runtime GraphQL. By far the most requested feature for the data layer! Soon you&apos;ll be able to query GraphQL — not just at build time — but from functions and during SSR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Kyle Mathews &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/scaling-rsg-builds-with-gatsbys-data-layer/&quot;&gt;blog post for more Data Layer goodies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been five minor Gatsby releases while I&apos;ve enjoyed the summer 🤯 Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/releases&quot;&gt;release log&lt;/a&gt; to get up to speed. But here are some of my favs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/EK74ACNxM7M&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./stream-screendump.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stream Screendump&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR: If you did (or do) watch the show, you&apos;ll see that I have sneakily done some cleaning up and solved our little environment variable problem by making sure I load them in the gatsby-config 🤦‍♀️ 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source data from the avatars table on build, so that the little avatars are present as part of the statically generated version of the marketing page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets rid of the tiny flicker of no content, and why call Supabase every time someone lands on the marketing page for &lt;a href=&quot;https://prune.raae.tech&quot;&gt;Prune your follows&lt;/a&gt; when there is no need? You can also use your service key when sourcing, allowing you to even information from otherwise locked down table rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://prune.raae.tech&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./prune-avatars.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screendump of avatars on Prune your follows&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetch data on avatars using the Supabase SKD this time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Gatsby node for each avatar using &lt;code&gt;createNode&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;createNodeId&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;createContentDigest&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: gatsby-node.js
// Note: Error handling omitted

const { createClient } = require(&amp;quot;@supabase/supabase-js&amp;quot;);

const supabaseUrl = process.env.GATSBY_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseServiceKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY;

const serviceSupabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceKey);

exports.sourceNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest, reporter } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode } = actions;

  const { data } = await serviceSupabase
    .from(&amp;quot;avatars&amp;quot;)
    .select(&amp;quot;username, avatar_url&amp;quot;)
    .limit(20);

  data.forEach((item) =&amp;gt; {
    createNode({
      id: createNodeId(item.username),
      avatarUrl: item.avatar_url,
      username: item.username,
      internal: {
        type: &amp;quot;UserAvatar&amp;quot;,
        contentDigest: createContentDigest(item),
      },
    });
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And voila, we have avatar nodes in the data layer we may use in the &lt;code&gt;Avatars&lt;/code&gt; component:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;// File: Avatars.js
// Note: Styling omitted

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from &amp;quot;gatsby&amp;quot;;

export function Avatars() {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      allUserAvatar {
        nodes {
          username
          avatarUrl
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      {data.allUserAvatar.nodes.map((user) =&amp;gt; {
        return (
          &amp;lt;img key={user.username} src={user.avatarUrl} alt={user.username} /&amp;gt;
        );
      })}
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will source these little avatars on today&apos;s show from a Supabase table into the Gatsby Data Layer to make them statically generated! At the moment, these are fetched client side.&lt;/p&gt;

There seems to be a magical 5000 limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been toying with the idea of making a little tool to help me find accounts to unfollow... So when Supabase announced their launch week hackathon, I jumped right in and got hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is not the cleanest, but it works, and I have already unfollowed a bunch of accounts - success 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: What would you like to know more about when it comes to Gatsby?&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>📥 🎉 ~ createRemoteFileNode does return something useful</title><link>https://queen.raae.codes/2022-06-22-create-remote-file-node/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://queen.raae.codes/2022-06-22-create-remote-file-node/</guid><description>createRemoteFileNode does not return something useful, as opposed to createNode: js // gatsby-node.js const { createRemoteFileNode } =…</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;createRemoteFileNode&lt;/code&gt; does not return something useful, as &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-06-21-create-node/&quot;&gt;opposed to createNode&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
const { createRemoteFileNode } = require(`gatsby-source-filesystem`);

exports.sourceNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest, getCache } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode } = actions;

  const awaitedNode = await createRemoteFileNode({
    url: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1638913658179-18c9a9c943f7`,
    getCache,
    createNode,
    createNodeId,
  });
  console.log(&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; awaitedNode:&amp;quot;, awaitedNode); // 👈
  // Console:
  // &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; awaitedNode: {
  // id: &apos;48891c31-1e53-502d-a55f-d4b136548a1d&apos;,
  // children: [],
  // parent: null,

}
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore you can use the returned data to create a child-parent link in &lt;code&gt;onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt;, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
const { createRemoteFileNode } = require(`gatsby-source-filesystem`);

exports.onCreateNode = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { node, actions, createNodeId, getCache } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode, createParentChildLink } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type !== &amp;quot;Parent&amp;quot;) return;

  const childFileNode = await createRemoteFileNode({
    url: node.coverUrl, // or any field that is a file url
    getCache,
    createNode,
    createNodeId,
  });

  // 👇👇👇
  createParentChildLink({ parent: node, child: childFileNode });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js

// Should be sourced or derived, only for example purposes
const DATA = { id: &amp;quot;unique&amp;quot;, hello: &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; };

exports.sourceNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode } = actions;

  const awaitedNode = await createNode({
    ...DATA,
    id: createNodeId(`example-node-${DATA.id}`),
    internal: {
      type: `BadExample`,
      contentDigest: createContentDigest(DATA),
    },
  });
  console.log(&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; awaitedNode:&amp;quot;, awaitedNode); // 👈
  // Console:
  // &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; awaitedNode: []
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore to create a child-parent link in &lt;code&gt;onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt; for instance, you need to keep a reference to the id yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js

// Should be sourced or derived, only for example purposes
const DATA = { id: &amp;quot;unique&amp;quot;, hello: &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; };

exports.onCreateNode = (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { node, actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode, createParentChildLink } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type !== &amp;quot;Parent&amp;quot;) return;

  const nodeId = createNodeId(`example-node-${DATA.id}`); // 👈

  createNode({
    ...DATA,
    id: nodeId, // 👈
    internal: {
      type: `Child`,
      contentDigest: createContentDigest(DATA),
    },
  });

  // 👇👇👇
  createParentChildLink({ parent: node, child: { id: nodeId } });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more common version of the code above that you see in examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js

// Should be sourced or derived, only for example purposes
const DATA = { id: &amp;quot;unique&amp;quot;, hello: &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; };

exports.onCreateNode = (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { node, actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode, createParentChildLink } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type !== &amp;quot;Parent&amp;quot;) return;

  const childNode = {
    ...DATA,
    id: createNodeId(`example-node-${DATA.id}`),
    internal: {
      type: `Child`,
      contentDigest: createContentDigest(DATA),
    },
  };

  // 👇👇👇
  createNode(childNode);
  createParentChildLink({ parent: node, child: childNode });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I&apos;m not too fond of indicating that the data object describing the node is already an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; node in the data layer, so I prefer my initial solution as only the id is needed to create the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

LMK, if that could be you 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week is &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactnorway.com/&quot;&gt;React Norway&lt;/a&gt;. We&apos;ll get to hang out with our contact at Cloudinary and other awesome peeps as a gentle introduction to workcation 2020!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No streams or regular content until late August, but we&apos;ll follow up with our clients and maybe do some recreational coding. It depends on how much rain we get, I suppose ☔️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do love a good workcation, as you can see in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/fpFY82efGPI&quot;&gt;this vlog from 2020&lt;/a&gt; ☀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s hang if you find yourself on the west coast of Sweden in July or in Oslo in August. Send me a DM on Twitter, and we&apos;ll figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;

But by adding &lt;code&gt;@dontInfer&lt;/code&gt; (or similar), you remove your users&apos; ability to add fields using &lt;code&gt;createNodeField&lt;/code&gt;. A common approach to extending the functionality of your plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicitly typing out what you expect to be available on your node types is super helpful, but limiting your users like that can be super stressful and hard to debug for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this new? Did custom fields use to show up even with &lt;code&gt;@dontInfer&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I missing something here that would change my mind?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/QB1Y8dWZpgM&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./youtube-screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube Screengrab&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get a genuinely atomic build by sourcing remote images into your Gatsby Data Layer as File nodes. Pointing to a URL you do not control on the world wide web is not a super robust solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graysonhicks/gatsby-plugin-remote-images&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-remote-images&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/graysonhicks&quot;&gt;Grayson Hicks&lt;/a&gt;, Staff Software Engineer at Gatsby in our web-scraping ScrapingBee demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, more broadly, utilizing the Gatsby Plugin Ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we do not have to go through the motions of creating remote file nodes ourselves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, more broadly, let&apos;s not do it all in one plugin. Many plugins, for instance, create remote filed nodes, then realize the need to add an option to disable such functionality. Maybe the images should rather be uploaded to Cloudinary... Offloading the functionality to gatsby-plugin-remote-images such an option is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the plugin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;yarn add gatsby-plugin-remote-images
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and add it to your Gatsby configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-remote-images`,
      options: {
        nodeType: &amp;quot;CrowdcastWebinar&amp;quot;,
        imagePath: &amp;quot;coverSrc&amp;quot;,
        name: &amp;quot;cover&amp;quot;,
      },
    },
  ],
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will create a file node for the remote image found at &lt;code&gt;coverSrc&lt;/code&gt; on a &lt;code&gt;CrowdcastWebinar&lt;/code&gt; node and make it available on &lt;code&gt;cover&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at yesterday&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-demo-web-scraping/pull/5/files&quot;&gt;Pull Request&lt;/a&gt; for the complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some nifty options if the structure of your nodes is not as straightforward as for &lt;code&gt;CrowdcastWebinar&lt;/code&gt;. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graysonhicks/gatsby-plugin-remote-images&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-remote-images docs&lt;/a&gt; for those and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to use the file with the Gatsby Image component, make sure you follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-image instructions&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Wqilgl_V7FA&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./youtube-screengrab_lol.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube Screengrab of crazy looking queen&quot; title=&quot;Caption this 🤪&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trigger Stripe Checkout Session with metadata&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes your Stripe Webhook expects there to be metadata attached to the Checkout Session. In our case, we want to grant access to a private Github repository and therefore add the Github username to the Checkout Session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add or override the data on resources when triggering events using &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/cli/trigger#trigger-add&quot;&gt;the add flag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation lets us know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;--add [resource]:[path1].[path2]=[value]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add metadata to a Stripe Checkout Session, &lt;code&gt;resource&lt;/code&gt; should be swapped for &amp;quot;checkout_session &lt;code&gt;path1&lt;/code&gt; for &amp;quot;metadata&amp;quot; and &lt;code&gt;path2&lt;/code&gt; for your custom metadata key. In our case, &amp;quot;github&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;--add checkout_session:metadata.github=olavea
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we use the above when triggering events, such as &amp;quot;checkout.session.completed&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;stripe trigger checkout.session.completed --add checkout_session:metadata.github=olavea
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
I had to upgrade my Stripe CLI to get this functionality, so I believe this is a new addition in the last year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;

Let us know if you use either gatsby-source-cloudinary or gatsby-transformer-cloudinary. We could use some beta testers for our upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week Gatsby released the &lt;code&gt;Script&lt;/code&gt; component as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.15/&quot;&gt;v4.15&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier to &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-01-05-external-scripts/&quot;&gt;add third-party/external&lt;/a&gt; or custom scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to make use of it in our gatsby-remark-oembed plugin. Maybe it should be the topic for this week&apos;s Deep Dive 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/y2oIg8xvWC0&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab of stream&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get more than the first page of results from an external API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, that means more than the &amp;quot;max results&amp;quot; returned from each request to the resources endpoint of the Cloudinary API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pagination is needed to solve the bug &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues/5&quot;&gt;Only returns up to 500 results&lt;/a&gt; in gatsby-source-cloudinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&apos;s on us to fix it as Cloudinary has hired us to make sure their Gatsby Plugins are up-to-date by summer 🎉🎉🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two fundamental ways for solving pagination: recursion and iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both solve the use case &amp;quot;if there are more results, ask the API for the next page of results&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To not repeatedly ask for the same page, the API needs to know something about the requested page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be the index of the page you are requesting, as seen in the ConvertKit &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.convertkit.com/#list-subscribers&quot;&gt;subscribers endpoint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or it can be the concept of a cursor as used by Cloudinary. If there are more possible resources than included in the response, Cloudinary adds a next cursor value you then need to provide to the subsequent request for resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recursion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recursion is when a function calls itself within its code. It&apos;s a great way to get the same code to execute again and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you must also make sure you stop at some point, or you&apos;ll continue to infinity and beyond (yes, I did just rewatch Toy Story with the Pirate Princess).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;toy-story-buzz-lightyear.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Buzz Lightyear spreading his wings and saying &amp;quot;to infinity and beyond&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we only let &lt;code&gt;createCloudinaryNodes&lt;/code&gt; call itself if there is a next cursor present in the response coming from Cloudinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
// ... import and configure cloudinary
const createCloudinaryNodes = async (gatsbyUtils, nextCursor) =&amp;gt; {
  const result = await cloudinary.api.resources({
    resource_type: &amp;quot;image&amp;quot;,
    next_cursor: nextCursor,
  });

  gatsbyUtils.reporter.info(
    `Fetched Cloudinary Assets &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ${result.resources.length} from ${nextCursor}`
  );

  // ... create a node for each resource in result.resource

  if (result.next_cursor) {
    await createCloudinaryNodes(gatsbyUtils, result.next_cursor);
  }
};

exports.sourceNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  await createCloudinaryNodes(gatsbyUtils);
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Iteration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the iterative solution, we used a do...while loop. The code in the do part of do...while loop will always execute once. And then keep on executing as long as the while condition is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we will keep requesting a new page of resources from Cloudinary until Cloudinary does not respond with the next cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
// ... import and configure cloudinary
const createCloudinaryNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  let nextCursor = null;

  do {
    const result = await cloudinary.api.resources({
      resource_type: &amp;quot;image&amp;quot;,
      next_cursor: nextCursor,
    });

    gatsbyUtils.reporter.info(
      `Fetched Cloudinary Assets &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ${result.resources.length} from ${nextCursor}`
    );

    // ... create a node for each resource in result.resource

    nextCursor = result.next_cursor;
  } while (nextCursor);
};

exports.sourceNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  await createCloudinaryNodes(gatsbyUtils);
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More code!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot; code check out and how to limit the number of resources fetched, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-demo-api-pagination&quot;&gt;the demo code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

The persisted storage for nodes in v4 breaks this unintended pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we mean by direct manipulation of a node? Direct manipulation assigns properties to the node like it was a regular JavaScript Object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, before v4 we could have done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;exports.onCreateNode = async (gatsbyUtils, pluginOptions) =&amp;gt; {
  // Code lifted from gatsby-source-youtube-oembed
  // Downloads the thumbnail as a file for YouTube nodes
  // and connects the created file node to the YouTube node
  // via the property thumbnailFileId
  const { node, reporter, createNodeId, getCache } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode } = gatsbyUtils.actions;

  if (node.internal.type === &amp;quot;YouTube&amp;quot;) {
    const imageFile = await createRemoteFileNode({
      // The url of the remote file
      url: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_url,
      parentNodeId: node.id,
      getCache,
      createNode,
      createNodeId,
    });

    node.thumbnailFileId = imageFile.id; // 👈👈👈
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that will no longer work. &lt;code&gt;thumbnailFileId&lt;/code&gt; will not be added to the node. If you need to add data after a node is created, you must use &lt;code&gt;createNodeField&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchange&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;node.thumbnailFileId = imageFile.id;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;createNodeField({
  node,
  name: `thumbnailFileId`,
  value: imageFile.id,
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you are good to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pretty straightforward rule, but sourcing data usually introduces asynchronous code. And with asynchronous code, you can quickly end up in a situation where you create nodes outside &lt;code&gt;sourceNodes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it still usually works, at least for a few nodes and often in development. However, when you deploy, it falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see inconsistent and weird behavior around node creation, your issue is probably nodes created outside of &lt;code&gt;sourceNodes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt;. Or direct manipulation of nodes; the topic for &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-05-26-direct-mutation/&quot;&gt;tomorrow&apos;s email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an excellent example in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/debugging-async-lifecycles/&quot;&gt;the Gatsby Docs&lt;/a&gt;, but here is another one without the use of &lt;code&gt;.then&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js

const cloudinary = require(&amp;quot;cloudinary&amp;quot;).v2;

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

const createCloudinaryNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { actions, reporter, createNodeId, createContentDigest } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode } = actions;

  const result = await cloudinary.api.resources({
    resource_type: &amp;quot;image&amp;quot;,
  });

  result.resources.forEach((resource) =&amp;gt; {
    reporter.info(`Create CloudinaryAsset &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ${resource.public_id}`);
    createNode({
      id: createNodeId(resource.public_id),
      ...resource,
      internal: {
        type: &amp;quot;CloudinaryAsset&amp;quot;,
        content: JSON.stringify(resource),
        contentDigest: createContentDigest(resource),
      },
    });
  });
};

exports.sourceNodes = (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { reporter } = gatsbyUtils;

  reporter.info(&amp;quot;sourceNodes - START&amp;quot;);
  createCloudinaryNodes(gatsbyUtils);
  reporter.info(&amp;quot;sourceNodes - DONE&amp;quot;);
};

// CONSOLE OUTPUT
// info sourceNodes - START
// info sourceNodes - DONE
// info Create CloudinaryAsset &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; queen.raae.codes-test-5/static/raae-avatar
// info Create CloudinaryAsset &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; queen.raae.codes-test-5/static/raae
// ... more nodes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;quot;console output,&amp;quot; you see that nodes are created outside of &lt;code&gt;sourceNodes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix is to await &lt;code&gt;createCloudinaryNodes&apos;and make &lt;/code&gt;exports.sourceNodes` an asyncrounous functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;exports.sourceNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { reporter } = gatsbyUtils;

  reporter.info(&amp;quot;Sourcing nodes - START&amp;quot;);
  await createCloudinaryNodes(gatsbyUtils);
  reporter.info(&amp;quot;Sourcing nodes - DONE&amp;quot;);
};

// CONSOLE OUTPUT
// info sourceNodes - START
// info Create CloudinaryAsset &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; queen.raae.codes-test-5/static/raae-avatar
// info Create CloudinaryAsset &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; queen.raae.codes-test-5/static/raae
// ... more nodes
// info sourceNodes - DONE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never in a resolver or anywhere else, even though I stumble over Gatsby Docs pointing in that direction every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1527593806513709057?s=20&amp;amp;t=8HbGrJ66ytV2IfM0qvwhDw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./youtube-spam.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hi Queen Raae, Our team has reviewed your content, and we think you may need to make changes to make sure it doesn&apos;t violate our spam, deceptive practices and scams policy. In the meantime, we&apos;ve made the following content private&quot; title=&quot;YouTube Email&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We removed it in exchanging for ImageCDN on a &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-03-25-image-cdn-plugin/&quot;&gt;treasure hunt with Ward of Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;, but as we are working on a plugin, I later realized it should support both 🤦‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/IDW2IfaHGIs&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./../../03/25-image-cdn-plugin/youtube-screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab of Ward stream&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the user of our plugin (gatsby-source-youtube-oembed) decide if they want to utilize Gatsby ImageCDN or download remote images as local file nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&apos;t know where our users are deploying their sites as plugin authors. As far as I know, only Netlify and Gatsby Cloud support Gatsby ImageCDN at the moment, and it&apos;s pretty clear they&apos;ll charge extra for it in the future. Also, some Gatsby users deploy to their own servers or other static hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We added a plugin option letting the user configure their choice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
exports.pluginOptionsSchema = ({ Joi }) =&amp;gt; {
  return Joi.object({
    thumbnailMode: Joi.string().valid(&amp;quot;none&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cdn&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;download&amp;quot;).default(&amp;quot;cdn&amp;quot;),
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we made sure to check the plugin option in onCreateNode to decide what type of thumbnail node to make:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
const { createRemoteFileNode } = require(&amp;quot;gatsby-source-filesystem&amp;quot;);

exports.onCreateNode = async (gatsbyUtils, pluginOptions) =&amp;gt; {
  const { node, actions, createNodeId, getCache } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode, createNodeField } = gatsbyUtils.actions;

  if (node.internal.type === YOUTUBE_TYPE) {
    if (pluginOptions.thumbnailMode === &amp;quot;cdn&amp;quot;) {
      createNode({
        id: createNodeId(`Thumbnail &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ${node.youTubeId}`),
        parent: node.id,
        youTubeId: node.youTubeId,
        url: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_url,
        mimeType: &amp;quot;image/jpeg&amp;quot;,
        filename: node.youTubeId + &amp;quot;.jpg&amp;quot;,
        height: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_height,
        width: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_width,
        internal: {
          type: &amp;quot;YouTubeThumbnail&amp;quot;,
          contentDigest: node.internal.contentDigest,
        },
      });
    } else if (pluginOptions.thumbnailMode === &amp;quot;download&amp;quot;) {
      const imageFile = await createRemoteFileNode({
        url: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_url,
        parentNodeId: node.id,
        getCache,
        createNode,
        createNodeId,
      });

      createNodeField({
        node: node,
        name: &amp;quot;thumbnailFileId&amp;quot;,
        value: imageFile.id,
      });
    }
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we recheck it to customize the schema according to the chosen mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
const {
  addRemoteFilePolyfillInterface,

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;export default function handler(req, res) {
  const { city, year } = req.body;
  res.send(`You time-travelled to ${city}, in year ${year}`);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But having the body served to you automagically as json, when it makes sense, is something I really like about Gatsby Functions. In most other serverless implementations, you have to parse it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to verifying the signature of a webhook using a third-party SDK, not so much! Most signature checks require access to the raw body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the longest time, we could not access the raw body in a Gatsby Function, but with the release of Gatbsy v4.14, we can 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To control the &lt;code&gt;body-parser&lt;/code&gt; middleware export an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/functions/middleware-and-helpers/#accessing-body-as-a-buffer&quot;&gt;object named &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const stripe = require(&amp;quot;stripe&amp;quot;)(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
const endpointSecret = process.env.STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET;

// Export a config object
// to configure the bodyParser
export const config = {
  bodyParser: {
    raw: {
      type: `*/*`,
    },
  },
};

export default function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    const sig = req.headers[&amp;quot;stripe-signature&amp;quot;];
    const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(req.body, sig, endpointSecret);

    // Handle the verified event,
    // event data can be trusted
    switch (event.type) {
      case &amp;quot;checkout.session.completed&amp;quot;:
        console.log(&amp;quot;CheckoutSession completed, fulfill the order!&amp;quot;);
        // Handle the event
        break;
      // ... handle other event types
      default:
        console.log(`Unhandled event type ${event.type}`);
    }

    res.status(200);
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn(err.message);
    res.status(400);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot seem to make this work locally, but I have verified that it works on Gatsby Cloud. I will, of course, follow up with Gatsby to figure out what&apos;s up. Is it a feature? Or a bug? I know my opinion on the matter 😬&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-06-01-raw-body-fix/&quot;&gt;Raw body works in develop from v4.16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am especially excited about being able to use the raw body sent to a Gatsby Serverless Functions. Stripe and others require it to verify if the request is valid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GraphQL Typegen also seems super interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./typegen.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Demo of types being available inside the editor automagically&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we&apos;ll make sure our gatsby-source-youtube-oEmbed plays nicely with both Gatsby ImageCDN and downloading the thumbnails as local files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting that next week Sanity is putting on what seems to be an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://structuredcontent.live/&quot;&gt;conference on Structured Content&lt;/a&gt;. We&apos;ll be attending the Oslo watch party!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/e/gatsby-gotchas-react/register?utm_source=profile&amp;amp;utm_medium=profile_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=profile`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search params, i.e.: &lt;code&gt;utm_source&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;utm_medium&lt;/code&gt; etc. should be removed and the path should be transformed into an absolute URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could split the string on &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; and add &lt;code&gt;https://www.crowdcast.io&lt;/code&gt;, but we can also reach for the Javascript&apos;s built-in URL constructor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const base = &amp;quot;https://www.crowdcast.io/&amp;quot;;
const path =
  &amp;quot;/e/gatsby-gotchas-react/register?utm_source=profile&amp;amp;utm_medium=profile_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=profile&amp;quot;;

const url = new URL(path, base);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the URL constructor results in a very useful object describing our URL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;{
  href: &apos;https://www.crowdcast.io/e/gatsby-gotchas-react/register?utm_source=profile&amp;amp;utm_medium=profile_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=profile&apos;,
  origin: &apos;https://www.crowdcast.io&apos;,
  protocol: &apos;https:&apos;,
  username: &apos;&apos;,
  password: &apos;&apos;,
  host: &apos;www.crowdcast.io&apos;,
  hostname: &apos;www.crowdcast.io&apos;,
  port: &apos;&apos;,
  pathname: &apos;/e/gatsby-gotchas-react/register&apos;,
  search: &apos;?utm_source=profile&amp;amp;utm_medium=profile_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=profile&apos;,
  searchParams: URLSearchParams {
    &apos;utm_source&apos; =&amp;gt; &apos;profile&apos;,
    &apos;utm_medium&apos; =&amp;gt; &apos;profile_web&apos;,
    &apos;utm_campaign&apos; =&amp;gt; &apos;profile&apos; },
  hash: &apos;&apos;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; URL add &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pathname&lt;/code&gt; together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const cleanUrl = url.origin + url.pathname;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should reach for the URL constructor anytime you need to work on a URL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice, for instance, how it gracefully handled a trailing slash for &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt;. String concatenation &lt;code&gt;base + path&lt;/code&gt; in this case would result in an invalid URL with a double slash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://www.crowdcast.io/e//gatsby-gotchas-react/register?utm_source=profile&amp;amp;utm_medium=profile_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=profile

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/MjcYzjYIFuI&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./youtube-screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube Screengrab&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source Crowdcast webinars into the Gatsby Data Layer using ScrapingBee — an API that simplifies web scraping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no official Crowdcast API and keeping the data in sync using copy/past is a pain (or at least boring 🤪). To scrape from Crowdcast, we need to load the page in a headless browser such as Puppeteer. Doing so is not possible as part of the Gatsby build process, so we outsource it to ScrapingBee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scrapingbee.com/features/data-extraction/&quot;&gt;Data Extraction&lt;/a&gt;-feature from ScrapingBee. It lets us select data on a page using CSS-selector. It felt kinda similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cheerio.js.org/&quot;&gt;cheerio&lt;/a&gt; if you have ever used that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I started with copy/pasting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scrapingbee.com/documentation/data-extraction/&quot;&gt;example snippets&lt;/a&gt;. It worked almost out of the box, but we had to make use of the &lt;code&gt;wait_for&lt;/code&gt; option as the Crowdcast page takes a while to load:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s sometimes necessary to wait for a particular element to appear in the DOM before ScrapingBee returns the HTML content.
&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scrapingbee.com/documentation/#wait_for&quot;&gt;ScrapingBee Docs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const axios = require(&amp;quot;axios&amp;quot;);

const scrapeCrowdcast = async () =&amp;gt; {
  const { data } = await axios.get(&amp;quot;https://app.scrapingbee.com/api/v1&amp;quot;, {
    params: {
      api_key: process.env.SCRAPING_BEE_API_KEY,
      url: &amp;quot;https://www.crowdcast.io/raae&amp;quot;,
      // Wait for there to be at least one
      // non-empty .event-tile element
      wait_for: &amp;quot;.event-tile&amp;quot;,
      extract_rules: {
        webinars: {
          // Lets create a list with data
          // extracted from the .event-tile element
          selector: &amp;quot;.event-tile&amp;quot;,
          type: &amp;quot;list&amp;quot;,
          // Each object in the list should
          output: {
            // have a title lifted from
            // the .event-tile__title element
            title: &amp;quot;.event-tile__title&amp;quot;,
            // and a path lifted from
            // the href attribute of the first link element
            path: {
              selector: &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;,
              output: &amp;quot;@href&amp;quot;,
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  });

  return data;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting data object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;{
  webinars: [
    {
      title: &amp;quot;5 Gatsby Gotchas to look out for as a React developer&amp;quot;,
      path: &amp;quot;/e/gatsby-gotchas-react?utm_source=profile&amp;amp;utm_medium=profile_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=profile&amp;quot;,
    },
    {
      title: &amp;quot;Testing your Gatsby Serverless Functions&amp;quot;,
      path: &amp;quot;/e/testing-your-functions?utm_source=profile&amp;amp;utm_medium=profile_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=profile&amp;quot;,
    },
    // and more
  ];
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then loop through the webinars on the data object creating content nodes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
exports.sourceNodes = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode } = actions;

  const data = await scrapeCrowdcast();

  for (const webinar of data.webinars) {
    createNode({
      id: createNodeId(webinar.path),
      title: webinar.title,
      url: &amp;quot;https://www.crowdcast.io&amp;quot; + webinar.path,
      rawScrape: webinar,
      internal: {
        type: `CrowdcastWebinar`,
        mediaType: `text/json`,
        content: JSON.stringify(webinar),
        contentDigest: createContentDigest(webinar),
      },
    });
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And voila, we have webinar nodes in our data layer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-graphql&quot;&gt;query MyQuery {
  allCrowdcastWebinar {
    nodes {
      title
      url
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redirect from &amp;quot;/signup&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;my.usepow.app/signup&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went forth and used &lt;code&gt;createRedirect&lt;/code&gt;, but it was not working when using the &amp;quot;Get Started&amp;quot; button on usepow.app. A button that is actually a link to &amp;quot;/signup&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usepow.app&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;usepow-button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the POW! Site header with the &amp;quot;Get Started&amp;quot; button&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it did not work as expected, I reviewed the code, and it was exactly like I would have solved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
exports.createPages = async ({ actions }) =&amp;gt; {
  const { createRedirect } = actions;
  createRedirect({
    fromPath: &amp;quot;/signup/&amp;quot;,
    toPath: &amp;quot;https://my.usepow.app/signup&amp;quot;,
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some careful investigation, I realized it worked when hitting &lt;code&gt;usepow.app/signup&lt;/code&gt; directly, but not when using the button 🧐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had another look at the documentation, and I got what &lt;code&gt;redirectInBrowser&lt;/code&gt; is meant for 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
exports.createPages = async ({ actions }) =&amp;gt; {
  const { createRedirect } = actions;
  createRedirect({
    fromPath: &amp;quot;/signup/&amp;quot;,
    toPath: &amp;quot;https://my.usepow.app/signup&amp;quot;,
    redirectInBrowser: true, // 👈👈👈
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...set redirectInBrowser to true and Gatsby will handle redirecting in the client as well...
&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createRedirect&quot;&gt;Gatsby Docs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Luckily for you, a Gatsby Source Plugin developer, you are not responsible for creating unique ids. You are only responsible for supplying a unique-within-your-universe-id to &lt;code&gt;createNodeId&lt;/code&gt;. Gatsby is responsible for returning a unique node id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;exports.sourceNodes = async ({ actions, createNodeId }) =&amp;gt; {
  const { createNode } = actions;

  createNode({
    id: createNodeId(&amp;quot;unique-within-your-universe-id&amp;quot;),

    // More fields

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;exports.sourceNodes = async ({ actions }) =&amp;gt; {
  const { createNode } = actions;
  const data = { hello: &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; };

  createNode({
    // More fields
    internal: {
      // More fields
      contentDigest: crypto
        .createHash(`md5`)
        .update(JSON.stringify(data))
        .digest(`hex`),
    },
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not technically wrong, but I prefer using &lt;code&gt;createContentDigest&lt;/code&gt; like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;exports.sourceNodes = async ({ actions, createContentDigest }) =&amp;gt; {
  const { createNode } = actions;
  const data = { hello: &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; };

  createNode({
    // More fields
    internal: {
      // More fields
      contentDigest: createContentDigest(data), // 👈👈👈
    },
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;internal.contentDigest&lt;/code&gt; is mandatory and thus part of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-01-20-minimal-viable-content-node/&quot;&gt;Minimal Viable Content Node&lt;/a&gt;. If this value has not changed, Gatsby uses the cached node instead of creating a new node, and for instance, &lt;code&gt;onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt; is not called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;contentDigest:&lt;/strong&gt; the digest for the content of this node. Helps Gatsby avoid doing extra work on data that hasn’t changed.

&lt;p&gt;To understand why this was happening, let us take a step back and look at how markdown can be represented as an Abstract Syntax Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree (mdast)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following markdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-md&quot;&gt;Intro text, [A link](https://youtu.be/fpFY82efGPI)!

[Another Link](https://youtu.be/fpFY82efGPI)

- [A third link](https://youtu.be/fpFY82efGPI)
- Some text
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as a Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree (mdast):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./mdast-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each box is called a node, a tree always springs out from a root node, and the nodes without any children are called leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, it is an upside-down tree as Ola pointed out 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby Transformer Remark takes the markdown files, transforms the markdown into mdast, and passes it onto our plugin. We then &amp;quot;walk&amp;quot; the tree looking for standalone links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./mdast-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we swap out the link node for an HTML node if it is indeed an oEmbed link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const tranformsLinkNodeToOembedNode = ({ node }, oembedResult) =&amp;gt; {
  node.type = &amp;quot;html&amp;quot;;
  node.value = oembedResult.html;
  delete node.children;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving us a slightly modified tree:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./mdast-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you spot the mistake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML node is a child of a paragraph node. Depending on the oEmbed HTML this might result in an invalid HTML structure when the mdast converts into HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pass along the parent paragraph node as the node to be exchanged for an html node instead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;mdast-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each MarkdownRemark-node Gatsby Remark oEmbed finds the standalone links, checks the oEmbed provider list for a match, and swaps the link out for the result coming back from the matching provider&apos;s oEmbed endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided early on to download the provider list on each build. oEmbed providers come and go with no effect on how the plugin should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provider list is downloaded and saved in the Gatsby Cache using the &lt;code&gt;onPreBootstrap&lt;/code&gt; lifecycle hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in October 2018, this did not work. I could not understand why, but it turned out to be a bug with the sub-plugin cache implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/8788&quot;&gt;got fixed by Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; in January 2019, and all was good in the world of Gatsby Remark oEmbed 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that did not last long. MDX took the world by storm. Gatsby Remark oEmbed, however, does not play nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-remark-oembed/pull/88&quot;&gt;Swizec figured out why&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue was that gatsby-plugin-mdx implements onPreBootstrap, overriding oEmbed&apos;s onPreBootstrap implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He changed the implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we try to use the list of providers, we now re-fetch it and update the cache if it isn&apos;t yet available in cache. This makes the plugin work with MDX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works 🎉🎉🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life gets in the way, and I never release a new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, and the fix no longer works 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the node transformation step, saving to the Gatsby Cache never sticks for sub-plugins. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/35415&quot;&gt;Check the bug report for more details&lt;/a&gt;, and feel free to make some noise with emojis and comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be solved by shipping the providers list with the plugin. It just feels wrong though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My presentation is on the what, why, and how of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-remark-oembed&quot;&gt;gatsby-remark-oembed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also cover the year-long journey at that point, including waiting for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/QIhrbJcqKu4?t=1975&quot;&gt;sub-plugin cache bug&lt;/a&gt; to be fixed before releasing the first version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and I am again struggling with a sub-plugin cache problem... More on that tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you might wonder what even is that and how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Gatsby Remark oEmbed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Gatsby Remark oEmbed is to let you drop in a link to embeddable content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-md&quot;&gt;Embed anything that supports the oEmbed protocol!

https://youtu.be/VhrOe0X_oA8

By adding a link on its own line!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And have it show up like so on your Gatsby site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./oEmbed-example.png&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube embedded in the html&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark&quot;&gt;gatsby-transformer-remark&lt;/a&gt; sub-plugin. Meaning it will only do work on MarkdownRemark-nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each MarkdownRemark-node Gatsby Remark oEmbed finds the standalone links, checks the oEmbed provider list for a match, and swaps the link out for the result coming back from the matching provider&apos;s oEmbed endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, that means swapping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://youtu.be/VhrOe0X_oA8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt;-value of the oEmbed response from YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;\ud83d\udd34 \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f Source YouTube information using oEmbed, no YouTube API Key needed \u00b7 #GatsbyJS Deep Dive&amp;quot;,

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that we got by calling YouTube&apos;s oEmbed endpoint with the original standalone link: https://www.youtube.com/oembed?url=https://youtu.be/VhrOe0X_oA8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the approach of using both titles and tags to find similar content, especially since I can be a little sloppy with my tags and have not retroactively added it all emails yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my titles are a little too similar... Loads of &amp;quot;How to&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Gatsby&amp;quot; give us some false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The similarity is calculated using: # of matching tags + 3.0 * title string similarity in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to remove &amp;quot;Gatsby&amp;quot; from the titles when comparing and set a threshold for when title similarity is activated to combat my issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to play around with the threshold, so I made it an argument so I would not have to run develop again and again to test threshold changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;exports.createResolvers = ({ createResolvers }) =&amp;gt;
  createResolvers({
    QueenEmail: {
      relatedEmails: {
        type: &amp;quot;[QueenEmail!]&amp;quot;,
        args: { limit: &amp;quot;Int&amp;quot;, titleTreshold: &amp;quot;Float&amp;quot; },
        async resolve(source, args, context, info) {
          const limit = args.limit || 3;
          const titleTreshold = args.titleTreshold || 0.7;

          let otherEmails = await context.nodeModel.runQuery({
            firstOnly: false,
            type: `QueenEmail`,
            query: {
              filter: {
                slug: {
                  ne: source.slug,
                }, // not current email
              },
            },
          });

          return otherEmails
            .map((email) =&amp;gt; {
              const intersectingTags = intersectionBy(
                source.tags,
                email.tags,
                &amp;quot;slug&amp;quot;
              );

              const titleScore = stringSimilarity.compareTwoStrings(
                source.title.replace(&amp;quot;Gatsby&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;),
                email.title
              );

              // titleSimilarity = 0 if treshold is not met
              const titleSimilarity =
                titleScore &amp;gt; titleTreshold ? titleScore : 0;

              return {
                ...email,
                similarity: intersectingTags.length + 3.0 * titleSimilarity,
              };
            })
            .filter(({ similarity }) =&amp;gt; similarity !== 0)
            .sort((a, b) =&amp;gt; {
              return b.similarity - a.similarity;
            })
            .slice(0, limit);
        },
      },
    },
  });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you compare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/reckoningdev&quot;&gt;@reckoningdev&lt;/a&gt; solution using a custom resolver feels much more like the Gatsby way of solving the use case than many other solutions I found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His selection criteria are pretty sophisticated, but you could opt for a random selection or any other criteria that makes sense on your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so ready to get back into the comfortable routine of everyday life after my month of traveling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spring, I am planning to overhaul my first ever Gatsby project: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-remark-oembed&quot;&gt;gatsby-remark-oembed&lt;/a&gt; — a plugin that transforms stand alone links into its oEmbed HTML counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like to get involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you have your own Gatsby-related Spring plans?&lt;br&gt;
Let me know, and I might share it with the list 🎁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week Gatsby released v4.12. Mostly bug fixes, but also two interesting RFC (Request for Comments):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35404&quot;&gt;RFC for new Script component in Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; - the script component will make it easier to incorporate 3rd party scripts without negatively impacting site performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35357&quot;&gt;RFC for new Bundler in Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; - Gatsby is evaluating other bundlers in order to deliver faster local development and production build speeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you have any options on that, jump in with a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; Airplane WIFI is still such a treat. Writing this while crossing the Atlantic after 4 hours on the tarmac without WIFI...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SEO for Devs&apos;s creator Monica Lent is a good friend of Queen Raae.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>✅ ⚙️ ~ How to fix inconsistent trailing slashes in Gatsby</title><link>https://queen.raae.codes/2022-04-06-trailing-slash/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://queen.raae.codes/2022-04-06-trailing-slash/</guid><description>I first learned about the problem of inconsistent trailing slashes from Monica Lent in her article How to Uncover Non-obvious SEO Mistakes on Gatsby Websites.…</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I first learned about the problem of inconsistent trailing slashes from Monica Lent in her article &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloggingfordevs.com/gatsby-seo/&quot;&gt;How to Uncover Non-obvious SEO Mistakes on Gatsby Websites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I experienced it when seeing &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; entries like &amp;quot;/timeline/&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;/timeline&amp;quot; in my POW! Analytics reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screengrab-fathom.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;/timeline/&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;/timeline&amp;quot; rows in the analytics report&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will happen if your internal links are inconsistent, but also if your internal links are consistently non-trailing slash while your hosting provider redirects from non-trailing to trailing URLs etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we no longer have to worry about getting it right; instead, you can configure Gatsby to make it consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, add &lt;code&gt;trailingSlash&lt;/code&gt; to your gatsby-config.js and choose between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;: Always add trailing slashes to each URL, e.g. /x to /x/.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;: Remove all trailing slashes on each URL, e.g. /x/ to /x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ignore&lt;/code&gt;: Don&apos;t automatically modify the URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go for &lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // ...
  ],
  trailingSlash: &amp;quot;always&amp;quot;,
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after upgrading to the latest version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-source-youtube-oembed&quot;&gt;@raae/gatsby-source-youtube-oembed&lt;/a&gt;, with support for Gatsby ImageCDN, my sourced YouTube Thumbnails went blank...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out support for Gatsby ImageCDN is not on by default; you need to set the environment variable &lt;code&gt;GATSBY_CLOUD_IMAGE_CDN&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./env-var.png&quot; alt=&quot;GATSBY_CLOUD_IMAGE_CDN=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing so and triggering a &amp;quot;Clear cache and deploy site,&amp;quot; the YouTube Thumbnails came back, and all was good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/nS36D2zUkvA&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./video-screengrab.png&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube Thumbnail via Gatsby ImageCDN on Netlify&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On yesterday&apos;s unauthorized and rum-fueled &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/SWumzHLEpYA&quot;&gt;treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, we worked through the code from the last two emails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022-03-30-deterministic/&quot;&gt;Gatsby&apos;s createNodeId is deterministic 📥 💡&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022-03-31-skip-cache/&quot;&gt;Should we skip the Gatsby Cache altogether? 🛑 🔄&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/SWumzHLEpYA&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./youtube-screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab of stream&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we also briefly touched on a bug I had to fix from last week&apos;s ImageCDN stream. The YouTubeThumbnail nodes were &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; between builds... 😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby caches nodes between builds. If you call &lt;code&gt;createNode&lt;/code&gt; with the same nodeId and content digest as a cached node, Gatsby will not go through the node creation process again. It will use the cached node, skipping &lt;code&gt;onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt; for that node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since caches can get out of hand, Gatsby throws out all nodes that are not &amp;quot;touched&amp;quot; during the node sourcing phase. And this is where our problem arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A node is considered touched either by the use of &lt;code&gt;createNode&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;touchNode&lt;/code&gt;. However, the code &amp;quot;touching&amp;quot; our YouTubeThumbnail nodes is skipped when its YouTube node is cached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily a node is also considered &amp;quot;touched&amp;quot; if its parent is &amp;quot;touched&amp;quot;: problem solved 👩‍👧&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;createNode({
  id: youTubeThumbnailNodeId,
  parent: node.id, // 👈 👈 👈
  youTubeId: node.youTubeId,
  url: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_url,
  mimeType: &amp;quot;image/jpeg&amp;quot;,
  filename: node.youTubeId + &amp;quot;.jpg&amp;quot;,
  height: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_height,
  width: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_width,
  internal: {
    type: YOUTUBE_THUMBNAIL_TYPE,
    contentDigest: node.internal.contentDigest,
  },
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const youTubeNodeId = createNodeId(`YouTube &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ${youTubeId}`);
const timestamp = await cache.get(youTubeNodeId);
const existingNode = getNode(youTubeNodeId);
const existingNodeAge = Date.now() - timestamp;

if (existingNode &amp;amp;&amp;amp; existingNodeAge &amp;lt;= refreshInterval) {
  // Node already exists, make sure it stays around
  touchNode(existingNode);
  reporter.info(`Touch YouTube Node for ${youTubeId}`);
} else {
  // Fetch oEmbed data and create node
  const embedData = await fetchEmbed(youTubeId);

  createNode({
    id: youTubeNodeId,
    youTubeId: youTubeId,
    oEmbed: embedData,
    internal: {
      type: &amp;quot;YouTube&amp;quot;,
      contentDigest: createContentDigest(embedData),
    },
  });

  await cache.set(youTubeNodeId, `${Date.now()}`);
  reporter.info(`Create YouTube Node for ${youTubeId}`);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doing so, another thought came to mind: Could we skip using the cache altogether?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems like we can, but should we?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const youTubeNodeId = createNodeId(`YouTube &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ${youTubeId}`);
const existingNode = getNode(youTubeNodeId);
const existingNodeAge = Date.now() - existingNode?.timestamp;

if (existingNode &amp;amp;&amp;amp; existingNodeAge &amp;lt;= refreshInterval) {
  // Node already exists, make sure it stays around
  touchNode(existingNode);
  reporter.info(`Touch YouTube Node for ${youTubeId}`);
} else {
  // Fetch oEmbed data and create node
  const embedData = await fetchEmbed(youTubeId);

  createNode({
    id: youTubeNodeId,
    youTubeId: youTubeId,
    oEmbed: embedData,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    internal: {
      type: &amp;quot;YouTube&amp;quot;,
      contentDigest: createContentDigest(embedData),
    },
  });

  reporter.info(`Create YouTube Node for ${youTubeId}`);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In computer science, a deterministic algorithm is an algorithm that, given a particular input, will always produce the same output[...] &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our Gatsby Source YouTube oEmbed Plugin, I did not trust this to be true. Complicating the code by caching the connection between the YouTube Id and the generated node id as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-03-18-cache/&quot;&gt;How to use the Gatsby Cache to skip subsequent external API calls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had this inkling it would make sense for it is deterministic and made sure to check with Ward when he guested last week&apos;s unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this week, I came over a source plugin in the wild that does not make use of &lt;code&gt;createNodeId&lt;/code&gt;&apos;s deterministic nature, prompting me to share this information with you and update the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-source-youtube-oembed/pull/8&quot;&gt;Gatsby Source YouTube oEmbed Plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/IDW2IfaHGIs&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./youtube-screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab of stream&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was his third time on the show; if you missed the other two, have fun catching up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/TX5XPuHhz9o&quot;&gt;File System Route API to create a page per YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/UsSJ_QNp6uo&quot;&gt;Deferred Static Generation (DSG) for older videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why add Gatsby ImageCDN support?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ward &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/IDW2IfaHGIs?t=4345&quot;&gt;said it best&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster builds (both local and in the cloud)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better performance in the browser compared to a CDN on a different domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding support for Gatsby ImageCDN still lets you deploy to other services like Netlify. Build time there will be faster, in the same way, it&apos;s faster locally, by only downloading the images in use by the site. The &amp;quot;old way&amp;quot; &lt;code&gt;createRemoteFileNode&lt;/code&gt; would eagerly download all images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to add Gatsby ImageCDN support?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll need to replace the use of &lt;code&gt;createRemoteFileNode&lt;/code&gt; with creating our own &lt;code&gt;RemoteFile&lt;/code&gt; nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many CMSs already have their own asset node type they can extend with &lt;code&gt;RemoteFile&lt;/code&gt;, but for our plugin, we first need to create a new node type that extends &lt;code&gt;RemoteFile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
const {
  addRemoteFilePolyfillInterface,
} = require(&amp;quot;gatsby-plugin-utils/polyfill-remote-file&amp;quot;);

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions, schema }) =&amp;gt; {
  actions.createTypes([
    addRemoteFilePolyfillInterface(
      schema.buildObjectType({
        name: `YouTubeThumbnail`,
        fields: {
          youTubeId: &amp;quot;String!&amp;quot;,
        },
        interfaces: [`Node`, `RemoteFile`],
      }),
      {
        schema,
        actions,
      }
    ),
  ]);
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;addRemoteFilePolyfillInterface&lt;/code&gt; makes sure the plugin works even if the Gatsby site is on a lower version than 4. To make sure it works on older versions even in develop, you want to add &lt;code&gt;polyfillImageServiceDevRoutes&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
const {
  polyfillImageServiceDevRoutes,
} = require(&amp;quot;gatsby-plugin-utils/polyfill-remote-file&amp;quot;);

exports.onCreateDevServer = ({ app }) =&amp;gt; {
  polyfillImageServiceDevRoutes(app);
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we are ready to replace our usage of &lt;code&gt;createRemoteFileNode&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt; 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;exports.onCreateNode = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { node, actions, reporter, createNodeId } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNodeField, createNode } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type === `YouTube`) {
    const youTubeThumbnailNodeId = createNodeId(
      `you-tube-thumbnail-${node.youTubeId}`
    );

    createNode({
      id: youTubeThumbnailNodeId,
      parent: node.id,
      youTubeId: node.youTubeId,
      url: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_url,
      mimeType: &amp;quot;image/jpeg&amp;quot;,
      filename: node.youTubeId + &amp;quot;.jpg&amp;quot;,
      height: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_height,
      width: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_width,
      internal: {
        type: `YouTubeThumbnail`,
        contentDigest: node.internal.contentDigest,
      },
    });

    createNodeField({
      node,
      name: `thumbnailFileId`,
      value: youTubeThumbnailNodeId,
    });

    reporter.info(
      `Created YouTubeThumbnail Node for ${node.youTubeId} thumbnail`
    );
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step for us is to update the YouTube Node&apos;s schema customization to use the new node type &lt;code&gt;YouTubeThumbnail&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
actions.createTypes([
  `
    type YouTube implements Node {
      thumbnail: YouTubeThumbnail @link(from: &amp;quot;youTubeId&amp;quot; by: &amp;quot;youTubeId&amp;quot;)
    }
  `,
]);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-source-youtube-oembed/pull/7/files&quot;&gt;Pull Request on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for the complete diff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach covered in yesterday&apos;s email used &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-03-23-page-components/&quot;&gt;multiple page components&lt;/a&gt;; the day before was &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-03-22-page-templates/&quot;&gt;multiple page templates&lt;/a&gt; and today we are covering my current favorite: &lt;em&gt;multiple parrot pages&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with the term parrot pages, it&apos;s what we call files system routes around the Gatsby islands 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiple Parrot Pages 🦜&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title is a little misleading as we cannot make multiple parrot pages for the same node type. But we&apos;ll use a nice little trick of creating new nodes named after the content type, resulting in the opportunity to make multiple parrot pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/
├─ pages/
│  ├─ post/
│  │  ├─ {Post.slug}.js
│  ├─ project/
│  │  ├─ {Project.slug}.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We create new nodes by hooking into the &lt;code&gt;onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt; extension point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
const { createFilePath } = require(&amp;quot;gatsby-source-filesystem&amp;quot;);

exports.onCreateNode = (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { actions, node, getNode, reporter, createNodeId } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNode } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type === &amp;quot;MarkdownRemark&amp;quot;) {
    const parentFileNode = getNode(node.parent);
    const contentType = parentFileNode?.sourceInstanceName || &amp;quot;&amp;quot;;

    const contentNodeId = createNodeId(`${node.id} &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ${contentType}`);
    const slug = createFilePath({ node: parentFileNode, getNode });

    createNode({
      id: contentNodeId,
      slug: slug,
      childMarkdownRemark: node.id, // 👈
      internal: {
        contentDigest: node.internal.contentDigest,
        type: contentType,
      },
    });

    reporter.info(`${contentType} created for ${slug}`);
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note of the childMarkdownRemark key added to the new node! It&apos;s what connects the new node to its content. However, if we query the new nodes at this point, we&apos;ll only get the node id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we get the full content? By modifying their schema using &lt;code&gt;@link&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) =&amp;gt; {
  const { createTypes } = actions;

  const typeDefs = `
    type Post implements Node {
      slug: String
      childMarkdownRemark: MarkdownRemark @link
    }
    type Project implements Node {
      slug: String
      childMarkdownRemark: MarkdownRemark @link
    }
  `;

  createTypes(typeDefs);
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now inside our parrot pages, we can query for the content on childMarkdownRemark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// {Post.slug}.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { graphql } from &amp;quot;gatsby&amp;quot;;

const PostPage = ({ data }) =&amp;gt; {
  const { html, frontmatter } = data.post?.childMarkdownRemark;
  const { title } = frontmatter;
  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;article&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;header&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{title}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;section dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
};

export default PostPage;

export const query = graphql`
  query ($id: String!) {
    post(id: { eq: $id }) {
      childMarkdownRemark {
        html
        frontmatter {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as the other days, the &lt;code&gt;sourceInstanceName&lt;/code&gt; used comes from configuring your &lt;code&gt;gatsby-source-filesystem&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/content/posts`,
        name: &amp;quot;Post&amp;quot;,
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/content/projects`,
        name: &amp;quot;Project&amp;quot;,
      },
    },
  ],
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you solve different page layouts for content with the same content node type but varying content types?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&apos;s email, we looked at a solution involving &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-03-22-page-templates/&quot;&gt;multiple page templates&lt;/a&gt;. Today we&apos;ll look at achieving the same with &lt;em&gt;multiple page components&lt;/em&gt;. And tomorrow we&apos;ll look at how to use &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-03-24-parrot-pages/&quot;&gt;parrot pages&lt;/a&gt; by making our own MarkdownRemark parent nodes 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiple Page Components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;em&gt;multiple page components&lt;/em&gt; approach, we can create the MarkdownRemark pages using either the &lt;code&gt;createPages&lt;/code&gt; extension point or the File Sytem Route API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then inside our root page component, we&apos;ll make sure to render the correct page component for our content type and pass on the queried data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// src/pages/{MarkdownRemark.fields__slug}.js
import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { graphql } from &amp;quot;gatsby&amp;quot;;

import PostTemplate from &amp;quot;../components/post-page&amp;quot;;
import ProjectTemplate from &amp;quot;../components/project-page&amp;quot;;

const components = {
  post: PostTemplate,
  project: ProjectTemplate,
};

const RemarkPage = ({ data, ...props }) =&amp;gt; {
  const contentType = data.markdownRemark?.parent.sourceInstanceName;
  const Component = components[contentType]; // 👈
  return &amp;lt;Component data={data.markdownRemark} {...props} /&amp;gt;;
};

export default RemarkPage;

// PostFragment defineded in the ../components/post-page.js file
// ProjectFragment defined in ../components/project-page.js file
export const query = graphql`
  query ($id: String!) {
    markdownRemark(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      ...ProjectFragment
      ...PostFragment
      parent {
        ... on File {
          sourceInstanceName
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If GraphQL Fragments are new to you, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/using-graphql-fragments/&quot;&gt;Using GraphQL Fragments &lt;/a&gt; article by Gatsby for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as yesterday, the &lt;code&gt;sourceInstanceName&lt;/code&gt; used comes from configuring your &lt;code&gt;gatsby-source-filesystem&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/content/posts`,
        name: &amp;quot;post&amp;quot;,
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/content/projects`,
        name: &amp;quot;project&amp;quot;,
      },
    },
  ],
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the slug is created using the &lt;code&gt;onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt; extension point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
const { createFilePath } = require(&amp;quot;gatsby-source-filesystem&amp;quot;);

exports.onCreateNode = (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { actions, node, getNode, reporter } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNodeField } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type === &amp;quot;MarkdownRemark&amp;quot;) {
    const slug = createFilePath({ node, getNode });
    const parent = getNode(node.parent);

    createNodeField({
      name: &amp;quot;slug&amp;quot;,
      node,
      value: parent.sourceInstanceName + slug,
    });

    reporter.info(`Create slug ${slug}`);
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you solve different page layouts for content with the same content node type but varying content types?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical example is sourcing both posts and projects content from markdown. Both posts and projects are added to the Gatsby Content Layer as MarkdownRemark Nodes. But are &amp;quot;logically&amp;quot; different content types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we&apos;ll look at three different approaches!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is using &lt;em&gt;multiple page templates&lt;/em&gt;. Tomorrow&apos;s email looks at &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-03-23-page-components/&quot;&gt;multiple page components&lt;/a&gt;, and then we&apos;ll round it off with my current favorite: &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-03-24-parrot-pages/&quot;&gt;parrot pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiple Page Templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;em&gt;multiple page templates&lt;/em&gt; approach, we&apos;ll use the &lt;code&gt;createPages&lt;/code&gt; extension point to create a page for each markdown file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something you probably have done before, but we&apos;ll extend on it a little and make sure it selects the correct page template for the content type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
const path = require(`path`);

exports.createPages = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { actions, graphql, reporter } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createPage } = actions;

  const { data } = await graphql(`
    {
      allMarkdownRemark {
        nodes {
          id
          fields {
            slug
          }
          parent {
            ... on File {
              sourceInstanceName
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  const templates = {
    post: path.resolve(`src/templates/post-template.js`),
    project: path.resolve(`src/templates/project-template.js`),
  };

  data.allMarkdownRemark.nodes.forEach((node) =&amp;gt; {
    const contentType = node.parent.sourceInstanceName;
    createPage({
      path: contentType + node.fields.slug,
      component: templates[contentType],
      context: {
        id: node.id,
      },
    });

    reporter.info(
      `Created page for slug ${node.fields.slug} with type ${contentType}`
    );
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sourceInstanceName&lt;/code&gt; used comes from configuring your &lt;code&gt;gatsby-source-filesystem&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: &amp;quot;post&amp;quot;,
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/content/projects`,
        name: &amp;quot;project&amp;quot;,
      },
    },
  ],
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the slug is created using the &lt;code&gt;onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt; extention point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
const { createFilePath } = require(&amp;quot;gatsby-source-filesystem&amp;quot;);

exports.onCreateNode = (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { actions, node, getNode, reporter } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNodeField } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type === &amp;quot;MarkdownRemark&amp;quot;) {
    const slug = createFilePath({ node, getNode });

    createNodeField({
      name: &amp;quot;slug&amp;quot;,
      node,
      value: slug,
    });

    reporter.info(`Create slug ${slug}`);
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you solve different page layouts for content with the same content node type but varying content types?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On yesterday&apos;s unauthorized and rum-fueled &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/rURKTRPvSos&quot;&gt;treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, we utilized the Gatsby Cache to skip fetching the YouTube oEmbed data again until the refresh interval is up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/rURKTRPvSos&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./youtube-screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab of stream&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an improvement on the ever-evolving @raae/gatsby-source-youtube-oembed. Next week Ward Peters from Gatsby will be on the stream to show us how to support Gatsby Image CDN 🤩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why would we do this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby has excellent caching built-in. If the YouTube oEmbed API response for a video has not changed, Gatsby will reuse the Gatsby YouTube Node that already exists, and the code in, for instance, &lt;code&gt;exports.onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt; will not rerun. Pretty sweet, as there we source an external image into the Gatsby Content Layer, which is heavy-duty stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Gatsy will call the YouTube oEmbed API for each video we are sourcing every time it runs through the &lt;code&gt;exports.sourceNodes&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls to external APIs can be time-consuming and sometimes even limited. I find this incredibly frustrating while developing, as I often rerun &lt;code&gt;gatsby develop&lt;/code&gt; multiple times, and I know the data has not changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby Cache to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How did we do it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After successfully fetching data from the YouTube oEmbed API and asking Gatsy to create a node with the data, we save the current timestamp and the id for the Gatsy YouTube Node created to cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;await cache.set(youTubeId, `${youTubeNodeId}&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;${Date.now()}`);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we can get that information from cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const youTubeCache = await cache.get(youTubeId);
const [existingNodeId, timestamp] = youTubeCache?.split(&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;) || [];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate if its time to fetch again from the YouTube oEmbed API or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no need to fetch the data again, we have no data, and we cannot Gatsby to create a Gatsby YouTube Node for us. However, if we do nothing, Gatsby will throw away the existing Gatsby YouTube Node from its cache as it&apos;s not &amp;quot;touched.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We let Gatsby know we would like to keep the Gatsby YouTube Node around by touching it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const existingNode = getNode(existingNodeId);
touchNode(existingNode);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complete code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the complete code; you can also see this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-source-youtube-oembed/pull/4&quot;&gt;@raae/gatsby-source-youtube-oembed Pull Request&lt;/a&gt; with minor improvements fitting for a plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;const createYouTubeNode = async (gatsbyUtils, youTubeId) =&amp;gt; {
  const {
    actions: { createNode, touchNode },
    createNodeId,
    createContentDigest,
    reporter,
    cache,
    getNode,
  } = gatsbyUtils;

  const youTubeCache = await cache.get(youTubeId);
  const [existingNodeId, timestamp] = youTubeCache?.split(&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;) || [];
  const existingNode = getNode(existingNodeId);
  const existingNodeAge = Date.now() - timestamp;
  const refreshInterval = 60000 * 5; // 5 min

  if (existingNode &amp;amp;&amp;amp; existingNodeAge &amp;lt;= refreshInterval) {
    // Skip fetching embed data,
    // but touch node to keep it arround
    touchNode(existingNode);
    reporter.info(`Touch YouTube Node for ${youTubeId}`);
  } else {
    const youTubeNodeId = createNodeId(`you-tube-${youTubeId}`);
    const embedData = await fetchEmbed(youTubeId);

    createNode({
      id: youTubeNodeId,
      youTubeId: youTubeId,
      oEmbed: embedData,
      internal: {
        type: `YouTube`,
        contentDigest: createContentDigest(embedData),
      },
    });

    await cache.set(youTubeId, `${youTubeNodeId}&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;${Date.now()}`);
    reporter.info(`Create YouTube Node for ${youTubeId}`);
  }
};

exports.sourceNodes = async (gatsbyUtils, pluginOptions) =&amp;gt; {
  const { youTubeIds } = pluginOptions;
  await Promise.all(youTubeIds.map((id) =&amp;gt; createYouTubeNode(gatsbyUtils, id)));
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Questions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine having a fully working integration demo done for you, created by experts in these exact frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete with a code repository on GitHub/CodeSandbox, and an engaging video walkthrough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don&apos;t take my word for it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hired Queen Raae to help my start-up with a really important project: demonstrating how our software can be integrated with a React application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a highly technical project that &lt;strong&gt;required a seasoned software engineer&lt;/strong&gt; to execute — and teach — well. She executed the project with very little oversight, taking the requirements and delivering solid solutions through her own trial, error, and understanding of our SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It allowed us to deliver an important project that will &lt;strong&gt;benefit our customers for a long time to come&lt;/strong&gt;, cost-effectively and without pulling our engineers away from their other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have a handy tip for us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git branch --sort=-committerdate  # DESC
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorting branches by the last commit date are super duper handy; you can even flip it around and get a list of the branches we maybe should stop hoarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git branch --sort=committerdate  # ASC

So, of course, I created a reusable plugin taking care of all the nitty-gritty work of setting MUI up correctly after getting it all to work on queen.raae.codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this week&apos;s unauthorized and rum-fueled &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/kzUUoglO63k&quot;&gt;treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, the time had come to add MUI to the new POW! marketing site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/kzUUoglO63k&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./youtube-screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab of stream&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since configuring MUI is a little more complex than what your average plugin options should handle, we are utilizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/&quot;&gt;Shadowing in Gatsby Themes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no real technical difference between a Gatsby Theme and a Gatsby Plugin, but Gatsby would like us to call plugins that have their own gatsby-config file or are set up for shadowing for themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might just rebel and call them all plugins, but for now, I have stuck to their recommendation and used the theme naming convention: @raae/gatsby-theme-mui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to shadowing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may replace any file located in the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;-folder of a plugin or theme with a file in your root Gatsby project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best explained with an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new POW! marketing site, we added @raae/gatsby-theme-mui to our project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we found the plugin&apos;s file structure by taking a peek in our node_modules folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@raae/
├─ gatsby-theme-mui/
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ ThemeRoot.js
│  │  ├─ config.js
│  │  ├─ getEmotionCache.js
│  │  ├─ theme.js
│  ├─ gatsby-browser.js
│  ├─ gatsby-node.js
│  ├─ gatsby-ssr.js
│  ├─ index.js
│  ├─ package.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to shadow the config.js file. By doing so, we replace the code that gets imported by the @raae/gatsby-theme-mui theme.js file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: @raae/gatsby-theme-mui/src/theme.js

import { createTheme, responsiveFontSizes } from &amp;quot;@mui/material/styles&amp;quot;;
import config from &amp;quot;./config&amp;quot;;

let theme = createTheme(config);
responsiveFontSizes(theme);

export default theme;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadowing is achieved by adding a new config.js file to our Gatsby project at a particular location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pow-site/
├─ src/
│  ├─ @raae/
│  │  ├─ gatsby-theme-mui/
│  │  │  ├─ config.js
│  ├─ pages/
│  ├─ templates/
│  ├─ ...more
├─ gatsby-node.js
├─ package.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// File: pow-site/src/@raae/gatsby-theme-mui/config.js

import { red } from &amp;quot;@mui/material/colors&amp;quot;;

const config = {
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: red.A700,
    },
  },
};

export default config;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And voila, we have changed the primary color to a POW! red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/olavea/pow-site/blob/main/src/%40raae/gatsby-theme-mui/config.js&quot;&gt;pow-site repository&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub for more detail, and take a look at Gatsby&apos;s official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/&quot;&gt;Shadowing in Gatsby Themes&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;

(&lt;a href=&quot;https://my.usepow.app/login/&quot;&gt;my.usepow.app&lt;/a&gt;) I choose the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mui.com/&quot;&gt;MUI Component Library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not ecstatic about the choice, but it gets the job done! And MUI really shines for more utilitarian use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My focus this spring is split between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving POW! for our users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping you get the most out of Gatsby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to free up a lot of head-space, we are standardizing on MUI across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week queen.raae.codes got the MUI treatment, and as you can see, it does not look very Material UI-y...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://queen.raae.codes&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./queen-shot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of queen.raae.codes&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big player in that is disabling &amp;quot;elevation&amp;quot; almost everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do it on a one-off basis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// On a per use basis
&amp;lt;Button disableElevation /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that gets annoying fast, and I like to make it a global thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// Globally

createTheme({
  components: {
    MuiButton: {
      defaultProps: {
        disableElevation: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last approach is also suitable for making more considerable stylistic changes to the default components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s see how I changed the list component for queen.raae.codes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;createTheme({
  MuiListItemText: {
    defaultProps: {
      // Change both the primary and secondary text
      secondaryTypographyProps: {
        variant: &amp;quot;overline&amp;quot;,
        gutterBottom: true,
      },
      primaryTypographyProps: {
        variant: &amp;quot;h5&amp;quot;,
        gutterBottom: true,
      },
    },
    styleOverrides: {
      // Move the secondary text to the top
      root: {
        display: &amp;quot;flex&amp;quot;,
        flexDirection: &amp;quot;column-reverse&amp;quot;,
      },
    },
  },
  MuiListItemButton: {
    styleOverrides: {
      // Add underline to emphasis it&apos;s a link
      root: {
        &amp;quot;.MuiListItemText-primary&amp;quot;: {
          textDecoration: &amp;quot;underline&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;&amp;amp;:hover&amp;quot;: {
            textDecoration: &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/subs/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./list.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before and after screenshot of the list component&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is POW?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POW! is the the privacy-first menstrual cycle journal I created as a proof of concept when working on the talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS36D2zUkvA&quot;&gt;A privacy first period tracker? Is it even possible?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is it relevant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POW! is built with Gatsby. The code so far is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/raae/pow-app&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;, and we&apos;ll be working on migrating the marketing site (currently on Squarespace 😳) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/olavea/pow-site&quot;&gt;to Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; — I see interesting POW! themed Gatsby Deep-Dives in our future....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can I help?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need folks willing to be interviewed about their current cycle logging habits. If that is you, or someone you know, send an email to hello@usepow.app or DM me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae&quot;&gt;@raae&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since many talks were well past my bedtime, I am looking forward to catching up with the recordings that should be coming to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/Gatsbyjs&quot;&gt;Gatsby YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/BzigfV2BiIE&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./show-screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab of Alexandra, Ola and me laughing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many of us in the world of web development past me created WordPress sites for a living. I stopped to focus on web apps rather than websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days the lines are getting blurry. Content plays a big part for apps, and content sites often add more interactive functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current numbers put websites powered by WordPress at over 30%. That is a lot of content stored in WordPress installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I believe it probably should stay stored there. But you should absolutly experiment with using some of that content in a Gatsy project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one article or one category of posts could benefit from the Gatsby approach? Weaved together with content and functionality from somewhere else like Shopify, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get off on the right foot, use a starter to get a sense of how it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby released a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-wordpress-homepage/&quot;&gt;Gatsby + WordPress starter&lt;/a&gt; this week, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gatsbywpthemes.com/&quot;&gt;Gatsby WP Themes&lt;/a&gt; has plugins, themes, and starters ready for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then maybe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; John asked in the chat if you could use .com as well as .org versions of WordPress. And yes, you may!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Gatsby Image CDN transformations of images are moved from the build to on-demand, waiting for the sharp transformations a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I never got around to setting up Cloudinary or Imgix and have enjoyed the ease of using &lt;code&gt;gatsby-plugin-image&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am planning on sourcing more of my existing content (like the YouTube streams) into queen.raae.codes, and not having to wait around for all those images transforming would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But alas, the beta so far is only for images sourced with &lt;code&gt;gatsby-source-contentful&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gatsby-source-wordpress&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately my site is markdown based using &lt;code&gt;gatsby-source-filesystem&lt;/code&gt;, so no experimentation for me yet 😢&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will, of course, investigate to figure out how we as developers may add support in our custom source plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the full Gatsby Image CDN announcement on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/image-cdn-lightning-fast-image-processing-for-gatsby-cloud/&quot;&gt;Gatsby Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; I am thinking of creating a course/bootcamp on developing and releasing Gatsby Plugins. Would that be of interest to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out there is not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AskGatsbyJS/status/1498697711134126086&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./tweet-sharp-answer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Thanks for reaching out! This isn&apos;t something we currently support, apologies for any inconvenience. We&apos;d love to gain more context on your use case; what challenges are you currently facing? Thanks again!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I have experienced sharp processing hanging, there is always a huge image file hanging around somewhere. Not sure how large is large, but to find your larger files, you can run this query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-graphql&quot;&gt;query MyQuery {
  allFile(sort: { order: DESC, fields: size }) {
    nodes {
      size
      prettySize
      relativePath
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in doing so myself, I see last year&apos;s Christmas card/drawing could be a tad bit smaller 🎄&lt;/p&gt;

Positioning&lt;/a&gt; with Slow Business Torill (@fjellflyt) and explored React Component testing in yesterday&apos;s unauthorized and rum-fueled &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/hzZOkTAvE8M&quot;&gt;treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The POW! app already has tests for some of the business logic but no tests for the user interface. I want to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, we explored adding components tests to the new POW! Marketing site Ola is working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, when it comes to testing with Gatsby, we followed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/testing/unit-testing/&quot;&gt;Gatsby Unit Testing Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exploring on stream and some work this morning, I decided on a strategy to test the pages&apos; semantic structure and make sure the page will render even when content is missing or incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does the page render without content?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// {MarkdownRemark.fields__slug}.test.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { create } from &amp;quot;react-test-renderer&amp;quot;;
import Page from &amp;quot;./{MarkdownRemark.fields__slug}&amp;quot;;

describe(&amp;quot;without content&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; {
  const root = create(&amp;lt;Page /&amp;gt;).root;
  it(&amp;quot;renders&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; {
    expect(root).toBeDefined();
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does the page render correct semantic HTML for the content?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// {MarkdownRemark.fields__slug}.test.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { create } from &amp;quot;react-test-renderer&amp;quot;;
import Page from &amp;quot;./{MarkdownRemark.fields__slug}&amp;quot;;

describe(&amp;quot;with typical content&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; {
  const root = create(
    &amp;lt;Page
      data={{
        markdownRemark: {
          frontmatter: {
            title: &amp;quot;Page title&amp;quot;,
          },
        },
      }}
    /&amp;gt;
  ).root;

  it(&amp;quot;uses h1 for page title&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; {
    const h1Element = root.findByType(&amp;quot;h1&amp;quot;);

    expect(h1Element).toBeDefined();
    expect(h1Element.props.children).toBe(&amp;quot;Page title&amp;quot;);
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does NOT render HTML elements for missing content?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// {MarkdownRemark.fields__slug}.test.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { create } from &amp;quot;react-test-renderer&amp;quot;;
import Page from &amp;quot;./{MarkdownRemark.fields__slug}&amp;quot;;

describe(&amp;quot;with missing title content&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; {
  const root = create(
    &amp;lt;Page
      data={{
        markdownRemark: {
          frontmatter: {},
        },
      }}
    /&amp;gt;
  ).root;

  it(&amp;quot;has no empty h1 for missing page title&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; {
    const checkForElement = () =&amp;gt; {
      root.findByType(&amp;quot;h1&amp;quot;);
    };

    expect(checkForElement).toThrow();
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope some of these examples make it easier for you to get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there seems to be quite a bit of outdated documentation, as I experienced when looking into &lt;code&gt;createResolvers&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An examples shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/schema-customization/#feeding-remote-images-into-gatsby-image&quot;&gt;creating remote file nodes&lt;/a&gt; as part of a custom resolver. It worked for me locally but failed on Gatsby Cloud, and I found out it is no longer supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also examples using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v3-to-v4/#___node-convention&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;___NODE Convention&lt;/code&gt; for linking nodes&lt;/a&gt; that will be deprecated in v5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Gatsby Version 4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-source-plugin-from-v3-to-v4/#2-data-mutations-need-to-happen-during-sourcenodes-or-oncreatenode&quot;&gt;All node creation and mutation need to happen during &lt;code&gt;sourceNodes&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;onCreateNode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v3-to-v4/#dont-mutate-nodes-outside-of-expected-apis&quot;&gt;Mutation is only allowed using the action &lt;code&gt;createNodeField&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined, we get the following recommended way of sourcing remote images:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;exports.onCreateNode = async (gatsbyUtils) =&amp;gt; {
  const { node, actions, reporter, createNodeId, getCache } = gatsbyUtils;
  const { createNodeField, createNode } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type === `YouTube`) {
    const imageFile = await createRemoteFileNode({
      // The url of the remote file
      url: node.oEmbed.thumbnail_url,
      parentNodeId: node.id,
      getCache,
      createNode,

&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I was interviewed by Benedikt of Userlist on my live streaming shenanigans for his and Brian&apos;s podcast Slow&amp;amp;Steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A podcast all about building products in public!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;recording.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Benedicte and Benedikt recording&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, a few episodes later, I became a co-host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give it a listen if you would like a backstage view of Queen Raae; learn more about POW! — the privacy-first menstrual cycle journal (my SaaS made with Gatsby, of course 🤣) and/or Benedikt&apos;s Userlist journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a month-ish, you also get to hear from other product folks we admire. January was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lesley_pizza&quot;&gt;@lesley_pizza&lt;/a&gt; of Newsletter Glue. Later this month, we interview &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/threehourcoffee&quot;&gt;@threehourcoffee&lt;/a&gt; of Llama Life, and in March, it&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/steveruizok&quot;&gt;@steveruizok&lt;/a&gt; of tldraw.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some episodes to get you started:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My first episode as a guest all about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slowandsteadypodcast.com/episodes/live-streaming-with-benedicte-raae&quot;&gt;live streaming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get to know our backstories on episode &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slowandsteadypodcast.com/episodes/one-hundred&quot;&gt;🥳 100! 🥳&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It seems like minor versions are coming bi-weekly these days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I plan to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.learnwithjason.dev/simplify-and-unify-data-access-with-netlify-graph&quot;&gt;Simplify &amp;amp; Unify Data Access With Netlify Graph&lt;/a&gt; on Learn with Jason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new Netlify Graph product, you can read, write, &amp;amp; even subscribe to data from third-party APIs securely — without having to manage auth tokens or complex data fetching logic. Sean Grove teaches us how!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Etheridge of Sanity.io visit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Content-Strategy-Seattle/events/283654504/&quot;&gt;Content Strategy Seattle&lt;/a&gt; looks interesting if you a European night owls or in a more convenient timezone.&lt;/p&gt;

And you…</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We added tests to the Gatsby Plugin Starter in yesterday&apos;s unauthorized and rum-fueled &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sj3YuX_TpVk&quot;&gt;treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you should too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great starting point is to test your &lt;code&gt;pluginOptionsSchema&lt;/code&gt; implementation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set up your test environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://jestjs.io/&quot;&gt;Jest&lt;/a&gt; and the needed extras to get it running with Gatsby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use yarn workspace, as I do for the Gatsby Plugin Starter, I recommend adding test-related packages and setup to your root workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add -D -W jest babel-jest react-test-renderer babel-preset-gatsby identity-obj-proxy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt; makes it a dev dependency, and &lt;code&gt;-W&lt;/code&gt; lets yarn know that &amp;quot;yes, I am sure I want this in the workspace root.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then follow the Gatby &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/testing/unit-testing/&quot;&gt;test documentation&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;code&gt;jest.config.js&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jest-preprocess.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;loadershim.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test continuously while developing, add a test command to your root package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;// package.json

&amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;: {
  &amp;quot;test&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;jest --watch&amp;quot;,
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the test before you allow a semantic release amend the semantic-release command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;// package.json

&amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;: {
  &amp;quot;semantic-release&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;jest &amp;amp;&amp;amp; semantic-release&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write your plugin schema tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it easier to test your schema implementation, Gatsby provides us with &lt;code&gt;testPluginOptionsSchema&lt;/code&gt;. Install &lt;code&gt;gatsby-plugin-utils&lt;/code&gt; the same way you installed &lt;code&gt;jest&lt;/code&gt; + friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add -W -D gatsby-plugin-utils&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you are ready to write your tests!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an example from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-starter/pull/29&quot;&gt;@raae/gatsby-plugin-starter&lt;/a&gt; work we did in yesterday&apos;s unauthorized and rum-fueled &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sj3YuX_TpVk&quot;&gt;treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatby-node.test.js

import { testPluginOptionsSchema } from &amp;quot;gatsby-plugin-utils&amp;quot;;
import { pluginOptionsSchema } from &amp;quot;./gatsby-node&amp;quot;;

describe(&amp;quot;pluginOptionsSchema&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; {
  describe(&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; {
    test(&amp;quot;string is valid message&amp;quot;, async () =&amp;gt; {
      const options = {
        message: &amp;quot;This is a valid message!&amp;quot;,
      };
      const { isValid } = await testPluginOptionsSchema(
        pluginOptionsSchema,
        options
      );

      expect(isValid).toBe(true);
    });

    test(&amp;quot;number is invalid message&amp;quot;, async () =&amp;gt; {
      const options = {
        message: 123,
      };
      const { isValid, errors } = await testPluginOptionsSchema(
        pluginOptionsSchema,
        options
      );

      expect(isValid).toBe(false);
      expect(errors).toEqual([`&amp;quot;message&amp;quot; must be a string`]);
    });
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern browsers support SVG favicons, and SVG can render text and en emoji is text 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link

/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this neat little trick from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chriscoyier&quot;&gt;@chriscoyier&lt;/a&gt;, who got it from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LeaVerou&quot;&gt;@LeaVerou&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@LeaVerou&apos;s Original &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1241619866475474946&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@chriscoyier article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/emojis-as-favicons/&quot;&gt;CSS Tricks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fun, and to test out the @GatsbyJS Plugin Starter, I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-svg-emoji-favicon&quot;&gt;@raae/gatsby-plugin-svg-emoji-favicon&lt;/a&gt; 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I often find myself reaching for it; favicons make any project seem more polished!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a good little plugin to look at to learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-svg-emoji-favicon/blob/main/plugin/gatsby-ssr.js&quot;&gt;how to add content to the head tag&lt;/a&gt; of your pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;

By doing so, Gatsby will verify that the plugin is configured correctly and stop everything if it is not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./option-error.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Options Error&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of your plugin will thank you for this immediate feedback. It saves them from reading through obscure &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; error messages or making sense of unexpected behavior when the reason is bad configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schema validation happens in the &lt;code&gt;gatby-node.js&lt;/code&gt; file, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://joi.dev&quot;&gt;Joi&lt;/a&gt; to describe the schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js

exports.pluginOptionsSchema = ({ Joi }) =&amp;gt; {
  return Joi.object({
    colors: Joi.array()
      .items(Joi.string())
      .min(1)
      .default([&amp;quot;#fff&amp;quot;])
      .description(&amp;quot;Array of hex color values&amp;quot;),
    intensity: Joi.string()
      .valid(&amp;quot;regular&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;light&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;blizzard&amp;quot;)
      .default(&amp;quot;regular&amp;quot;),
    duration: Joi.number()
      .integer()
      .min(1)
      .default(15)
      .description(&amp;quot;Duration of snowfall in seconds&amp;quot;),
    season: Joi.object()
      .keys({
        start: Joi.date().required(),
        end: Joi.date().required(),
      })
      .default({
        start: new Date(&amp;quot;December 1&amp;quot;),
        end: new Date(&amp;quot;January 4&amp;quot;),
      })
      .description(&amp;quot;Start and end date for when snow should be activated&amp;quot;),
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good thing we did, because in revamping the example plugin that comes with the starter, I had introduced a bug 🤦‍♀️ Watch me figure it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/eaZm9MC0GeE?t=2322&quot;&gt;live on the stream&lt;/a&gt; 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an easy enough fix, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-starter&quot;&gt;@raae/gatsby-plugin-starter&lt;/a&gt; is ready to be taken for a spin 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why use the starter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-starter&quot;&gt;The starter&lt;/a&gt; is a yarn workspace with both the plugin and a demo site configured for you. It makes it super fast to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even more excitedly, it comes with &lt;a href=&quot;https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/&quot;&gt;Semantic Release&lt;/a&gt; configured to release new versions of your plugin to npm based on your commit messages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If automation does not make you all excited, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/eaZm9MC0GeE?t=4124&quot;&gt;borrow some of mine&lt;/a&gt; 🤪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Be sure to let me know of any problems you might encounter!&lt;br&gt;
I love getting (e)mail 📬&lt;/p&gt;

I made it into this thing only developers better than I was worthy of doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out it&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages&quot;&gt;super straightforward&lt;/a&gt;; any folder of code with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file&quot;&gt;valid package.json&lt;/a&gt; may become an npm package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a free account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/&quot;&gt;npmjs.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your terminal, move into the folder you want to release as a package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;npm publish&lt;/code&gt; and follow the promps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s it; it will now be available for anyone anywhere to use 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the folder of code you decide to publish is worthy of becoming a package, though, that is another discussion altogether 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; You probably want to automate this process, and we will look at that in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/eaZm9MC0GeE&quot;&gt;tonight&apos;s unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode has dropped, and I love the title: The Great Gatsby with Queen Raae 😍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested to learn more about this “Great Gatsby”? How does it differ from others, and where is the industry headed? Time for a meeting with the Queen! The React team sits down with Queen Benedicte Raae, a software developer and overall coding wizard in this episode. They discuss the ONE feature of Gatsby that makes it so beginner friendly, what Queen Raae learned from her years of Wordpress and web building, and where they believe the conversation of “no-code vs code everything” is headed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reactroundup.com/the-great-gatsby-with-queen-raae-react-168&quot;&gt;LISTEN NOW ▶️&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gatsby is still hard at work with their Gatsby Conf, and you have until tomorrow 08:59 CET to enter the Gatsby Best of 2021 Agency Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.6/&quot;&gt;version v4.6&lt;/a&gt; last week. Is it just me, or are these coming more often than before? Personally, I am excited about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.6/#tracking-image-changes-in-markdown-files&quot;&gt;the markdown image fix&lt;/a&gt; 🖼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, Samuel Larsen-Disney released his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SamLarsenDisney/status/1487112270782025731?s=20&amp;amp;t=Yl7K-g2Iz1rrZTRHHm65Cw&quot;&gt;Elevating React Web Development with Gatsby: Practical guide to building performant, accessible, and interactive web apps with React and Gatsby.js 4&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/26CDRdhXozo&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./yt-photo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube Photo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve added timestamps to the description, so you can jump straight to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/26CDRdhXozo?t=261&quot;&gt;the why&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/26CDRdhXozo?t=520&quot;&gt;the how&lt;/a&gt; if you&apos;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TLDR version of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/26CDRdhXozo?t=1446&quot;&gt;I like a tidy ship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a local plugin, add a &lt;code&gt;plugins&lt;/code&gt;-folder to your project. Inside create a folder for your plugin with an empty package.json file. The name of your plugin will be the same as the name of this folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use your local plugin, add it to your plugins array the same way you would external plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend using the Gatsby pattern for naming plugins but replace &lt;code&gt;gatsby-&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;local-&lt;/code&gt; to make it super clear when looking at your gatsby-config that it&apos;s a local plugin. Otherwise, it&apos;s an easy mistake to go look for it on the npm registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local Plugin Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the folder structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gatsby-project/
├─ src/
│  ├─ &amp;lt;all your regular stuff&amp;gt;
├─ plugins/
│  ├─ local-source-youtube/
│  │  ├─ package.json
│  │  ├─ gatsby-node.js
├─ gatsby-config.js
├─ package.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you may configure the local plugin like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: &amp;quot;local-source-youtube&amp;quot;,
      options: {
        youTubeIds: [&amp;quot;Bk1jonYPFD4&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;TzJfepDjpzM&amp;quot;],
      },
    },
  ],
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also check out the code in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/olavea/pow-site/commits/stream-work&quot;&gt;stream work&lt;/a&gt; branch of the new pow-site repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
I hope you found this helpful!&lt;br&gt;
Let me know either way 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;

</content:encoded></item><item><title>📜 📜 ~ Is your gatsby-node.js getting out of hand?</title><link>https://queen.raae.codes/2022-01-27-plugins/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://queen.raae.codes/2022-01-27-plugins/</guid><description>We&apos;ve all been there; you just want to source a little here, create some pages there, and then before you know it, your gatsby-node.js is as long as a bad year…</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ve all been there; you just want to source a little here, create some pages there, and then before you know it, your gatsby-node.js is &lt;em&gt;as long as a bad year&lt;/em&gt; (Norwegian proverb).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code files becoming too long is not unique to gatsby-node.js. But there is a Gatsby way to solve it: plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I have no idea how to publish a plugin!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is you do not have to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/creating-a-local-plugin/#project-structure-for-a-local-plugin&quot;&gt;a local plugin&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or make use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/workspace&quot;&gt;yarn workspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, you may also use npm workspace, but I can never get those to work. If you do, please tell me your secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plugin may include more than the gatsby-node.js file. But it&apos;s the one that always gets out of hand first for me, so it&apos;s the one that pushed me to start modularizing with plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why make use of a Gatsby plugin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encapsulates a feature set across gatsby-node.js, gatsby-ssr.js, gatsby-browser.js, and Serverless Functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may even add a gatsby-config.js, but that tends to complicate things quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scanning the gatsby-config.js for your site makes it easy to get an overview of the feature set, assuming good naming practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you decide to create a private (or public) set of plugins, it&apos;s an easy transition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very little boilerplate is needed: a package.json file, and you are good to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Have you ever made a local plugin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oembed.com/&quot;&gt;oEmbed&lt;/a&gt; is likely one of the most underappreciated concepts of the open web. I first encountered it when WordPress added support back in my uni days; let&apos;s just say it been awhile 👵&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple yet powerful concept that I think would benefit from more awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you heard about or used oEmbed before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;oEmbed Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A provider: YouTube, SoundCloud, Issuu, Flickr, or your blog provides an oEmbed endpoint that accepts at a minimum an URL and returns embeddable content in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A GET request to &lt;code&gt;https://www.flickr.com/services/oembed/?url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/bees/2341623661/&lt;/code&gt; returns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take note of &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; on the YouTube response; it&apos;s all you need to embed a YouTube player to your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sourcing nodes with oEmbed data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Gatsby land, we can use oEmbed to ensure we have the correct embed snippet and/or the current title for our YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do so by using the &lt;code&gt;gatsby-node.js&lt;/code&gt; hook &lt;code&gt;sourceNodes&lt;/code&gt; where we create one content node per YouTube video and add the information from the oEmbed endpoint onto the node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js
// Full code without error handling

const axios = require(&amp;quot;axios&amp;quot;);

const YOUTUBE_IDS = [&amp;quot;Bk1jonYPFD4&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;TzJfepDjpzM&amp;quot;];

const fetchEmbed = async (id) =&amp;gt; {
  const ytUrl = `https://youtu.be/${id}`;
  const { data } = await axios.get(&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/oembed&amp;quot;, {
    params: {
      url: ytUrl,
    },
  });
  return data;
};

const prepYouTubeNode = async (
  id,
  { actions: { createNode }, createNodeId, createContentDigest }
) =&amp;gt; {
  const embedData = await fetchEmbed(id);

  createNode({
    id: createNodeId(`you-tube-${id}`),
    oEmbed: embedData,
    internal: {
      type: `YouTube`,
      contentDigest: createContentDigest(embedData),
    },
  });
};

exports.sourceNodes = async (params) =&amp;gt; {
  await Promise.all(YOUTUBE_IDS.map((id) =&amp;gt; prepYouTubeNode(id, params)));
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you like to see this code refactored into a plugin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

No?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sourcing content into the Gatsby Data Layer as content nodes is a little like shopping for ingredients! Chopping up and prepping those ingredients is similar to transforming those sourced content nodes to be ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are the prep type, you might have taken quickly to the Gatsby Data Layer; if you are not, maybe you feel it&apos;s an unnecessary step keeping you from making it up while you go and moving quickly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, if you are going to get the most out of Gatsby, you should probably become intimately familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, Ola and I had an interesting conversation last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How minimal can a content node be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out it can be very minimal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// gatsby-node.js

exports.sourceNodes = ({ actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest }) =&amp;gt; {
  const { createNode } = actions;

  const ID = `unique`;

  createNode({
    id: createNodeId(`minimal-content-node-${ID}`),
    internal: {
      type: `Minimal`,
      contentDigest: createContentDigest(ID),
    },
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A content node of type &lt;code&gt;Minimal&lt;/code&gt; is now available in the Gatsby Data Layer and can be queried for like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query MinimalQuery {
  minimal {
    internal {
      type
    }
    id
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resulting in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;minimal&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;internal&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Minimal&amp;quot;
      },
      &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;40c03aa4-b334-5ec8-a148-8f42e7bafbb4&amp;quot;
    }
  },
  &amp;quot;extensions&amp;quot;: {}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously not usable for anything, but in tonight&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhrOe0X_oA8&quot;&gt;unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; Deep Dive Edition, we&apos;ll build from here and create &lt;code&gt;YouTube&lt;/code&gt; content nodes containing the embed code and thumbnail fetched from YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Have you ever created your own content nodes?&lt;br&gt;
Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While live coding it on last week&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Wipi2lw6Mvc?t=3412&quot;&gt;unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt;, John asked an (as always) excellent question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would there be a use case for images in the markdown?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Wipi2lw6Mvc?t=3412&quot; title=&quot;Screengrab of John&apos;s question overlayed on the screen and Mirjam and I searching for an image on Unsplash&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./yt-screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Link directly to the answer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes absolutely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common use-cases would be page-specific open graph images, feature images for an article, or as in our case, an image per page section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-md&quot;&gt;---
sections:
  - title: About us
    md: ./about.md
    img:
      file: ./founder.jpg
      alt: Image of the founder holding a laptop
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot; access to the image referenced, make sure to add both &lt;code&gt;gatsby-plugin-sharp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gatsby-transformer-sharp&lt;/code&gt;. These plugins will transform all image files sourced by the &lt;code&gt;gatsby-source-filesystem&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;ImageSharp&lt;/code&gt; content nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll find the referenced image under &lt;code&gt;childImageSharp&lt;/code&gt;. The same way referenced markdown files are available as &lt;code&gt;childMarkdownRemark&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query ExampleQuery {
  markdownRemark {
    frontmatter {
      sections {
        title
        img {
          file {
            childImageSharp {
              gatsbyImageData
            }
          }
          alt
        }
        md {
          childMarkdownRemark {
            html
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Do you know if references to other types of files work the same way?&lt;br&gt;
Please let me know if you do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Wipi2lw6Mvc?t=803&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./yt-screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube Sceengrab&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tricks we covered is to reference a markdown file from the front matter of another markdown file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-md&quot;&gt;---
sections:
  - title: About us
    md: ../about.md
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gives you access to the fully transformed markdown node through childMarkdownRemark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query ExampleQuery {
  markdownRemark{
    frontmatter {
      sections {
        title
        md {

  }
}

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SSG is the default rendering mode in Gatsby. While the name has the word “static” in it, it doesn’t at all mean boring or lifeless. It simply means the entire site is pre-rendered into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at build time, which then get served as static assets to the browser. Because all of that HTML, CSS, and JS is preprocessed and rendered at build time, Static Site Generation serves websites to users in the fastest possible way—your content is ready to go before the visitor even visits the site. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/rendering-options/#static-site-generation-ssg&quot;&gt;Gatsby Docs about Rendering Options&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how do we SSG?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. React component in &lt;code&gt;src/pages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file generates a single page with the file&apos;s name as the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// src/pages/demo.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

const DemoPage = () =&amp;gt; {
  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Static Site Generation (SSG)&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
};

export default DemoPage;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generates a page at the path &lt;code&gt;/demo/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. File System Route API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file generates a page for each YouTube node in the data layer with the node&apos;s id as the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// src/pages/{YouTube.id}.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

const YouTubeFileSystemApiPage = () =&amp;gt; {
  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;File System Route API Page&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
};

export default YouTubeFileSystemApiPage;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generates a page at the path &lt;code&gt;/u-gq8cn-n-tbw-i/&lt;/code&gt; for the YouTube node with id: &lt;code&gt;UGq8cnNTbwI&lt;/code&gt;, and similarly for all the other YouTube nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;code&gt;createPages&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;gatsby-node.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code generates a page for each YouTube node in the data layer with the node&apos;s id as the path using the supplied template. The template will be a file very similar to the file examples above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// gatsby-node.js

const path = require(`path`);

exports.createPages = async ({graphql, actions}) =&amp;gt; {
  const {createPage} = actions;

  const result = await graphql(`
    {
      allYouTube {
        nodes {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  `);
  const templatePath = path.resolve(`./src/templates/youtube-template.js`);

  result.data.allYouTube.nodes.forEach((node) =&amp;gt; {
    createPage({
      path: node.id,
      component: templatePath,
      context: {
        id: node.id,
      },
    });
  });
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generates a page at the path &lt;code&gt;/UGq8cnNTbwI/&lt;/code&gt; for the YouTube node with id: &lt;code&gt;UGq8cnNTbwI&lt;/code&gt;, and similarly for all the other YouTube nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how the path here is a little different; &lt;code&gt;/UGq8cnNTbwI/&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;/u-gq8cn-n-tbw-i/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The File System Route API will run the id through the @sindresorhus/slugify package before using it as a path. While with &lt;code&gt;createPage&lt;/code&gt; we are responsible for making unique and valid paths ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content from the Gatsby Data Layer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can, and probably want to, sprinkle in content from the Gatsby Data Layer for all three ways of creating SSG pages. The Gatsby Data Layer holds all the data sourced at build time, making the content available when the site is statically generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical example would be to query for the YouTube Content Node corresponding to the page created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// src/{YouTube.id}.js
// src/templates/youtube-template.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import {graphql} from &amp;quot;gatsby&amp;quot;;

const YouTubePage = ({data}) =&amp;gt; {
  const {title} = data.youTube;
  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{title}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
};

export const query = graphql`
  query ($eq: String) {
    youTube(id: {eq: $eq}) {
      title
    }
  }
`;

export default YouTubePage;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can also query for content for pages created as Rect Components in &lt;code&gt;src/pages&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// src/pages/demo.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import {graphql, Link} from &amp;quot;gatsby&amp;quot;;

const DemoPage = ({data}) =&amp;gt; {
  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Static Site Generation (SSG)&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

      {data.allYouTube.nodes.map((node) =&amp;gt; {
        return (
          &amp;lt;Link to={node.id} key={node.id}&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;img alt={node.title} src={node.thumbnail_url} /&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/Link&amp;gt;
        );
      })}
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
};

export const query = graphql`
  {
    allYouTube {
      nodes {
        id
        title
        thumbnail_url
      }
    }
  }
`;

export default DemoPage;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh boy, this was longer and more difficult to demo than I imagined. If you have any questions, reply or add them as a comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/D_03KW4AkSk&quot;&gt;on the video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week there are two interesting webinars back to back on Thursday. One by Gatsby on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/resources/webinars/gatsby-peak-frontend-performance&quot;&gt;Peak Frontend Performance&lt;/a&gt; and one on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cfe.dev/events/managing-remote-state-react/&quot;&gt;Managing Remote State w/ React Query&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is not Gatsby specific, but Gatsby + React Query = a Nice Setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll have to watch them both after the fact, as Thursday is also the day for our unauthorized and rum-fueled &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/D_03KW4AkSk&quot;&gt;treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week fellow &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/&quot;&gt;Blogging for Devs&lt;/a&gt; member Philo Hermans released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/unlock-7&quot;&gt;Unlock&lt;/a&gt;. A product that should take all the pain out of selling software, including npm packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this could be a solution for those of us wanting to sell Gatsby Plugins...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of reaching for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/client-only-routes-and-user-authentication/#adjusting-routes-to-account-for-authenticated-users&quot;&gt;client-side only routes&lt;/a&gt; I more often utilize statically generated pages even for the authenticated routes these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can protect these routes the same way Gatsby documents for client-side only routes. However, this does not consider a visitor refreshing a page while on an authenticated route. The code will kick the visitor off the page before the authentication status is determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I recommend assuming the visitor is supposed to be there if they hit an authenticated route. While waiting for the data to load, I will show a skeleton version of the page. If it turns out the visitor is not supposed to be there, I kick them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A skeleton version of a page is as much of the user interface as is possible without the data only available client-side. There is often a lot to show, menus, headers, icons, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://my.usepow.app/profile/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./skeleton.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Skeleton Profile page&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the skeleton version of a profile page in action for &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.usepow.app/profile/&quot;&gt;POW!&lt;/a&gt;. If you get kicked off too soon, disable javascript to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach gives a better experience for visitors using your app correctly; they will get a smooth transition from skeleton to the page filled with data. Visitors testing out routes they should not be on will get a flash of skeleton page before being kicked off, a slightly subpar experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the same topic of discussion, and pair programming, as on yesterday&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/WzrjHVy134M&quot;&gt;unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, helping Mirjam with Conference Buddy v2.&lt;/p&gt;

In April of 2020, I got asked if I wanted to submit a talk for Gatsby Virtual Days. I did, and Gatsby sent over a microphone, and a ring light... and the rest, as they say, is history 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/kKp7Syxyxnw&quot;&gt;The talk&lt;/a&gt; walks you through how to create client-side only routes for authenticated users in Gatsby, following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/client-only-routes-and-user-authentication/#handling-client-only-routes-with-gatsby&quot;&gt;the approach found in the Gatsby Docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/kKp7Syxyxnw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./yt-thumbnail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube Thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days I like to generate a skeleton version of even these pages statically, then sprinkle in the user-specific data when it&apos;s loaded and ready. However, the above is still valid and is an excellent approach when converting an existing React app to Gatsby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Have you used Gatsby in a more app-like project?&lt;br&gt;
Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; Tonight we are helping Mirjam with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/WzrjHVy134M&quot;&gt;Conference Buddy v2 authentication flow&lt;/a&gt;, not tags as previously announced in Monday&apos;s email.&lt;/p&gt;

How would you go about including the external third-party script required?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the topic for my first ever Live Screencasts — concise, instructional videos on a single Gatsby topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Kldx6d5XBSE&quot;&gt;Watch the Live Screeencast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found three practical ways of doing so with Gatsby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. &lt;code&gt;onRenderBody&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent solution for global scripts must be available on every page, such as website analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;onRenderBody&lt;/code&gt;, the script is added when the site statically generates. The script tag is part of the initial HTML even before the site rehydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kldx6d5XBSE&amp;amp;t=74s&quot;&gt;Jump in to see &lt;code&gt;onRenderBody&lt;/code&gt; in action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

const headComponents = [
  &amp;lt;script
    key=&amp;quot;fathom-script&amp;quot;
    src=&amp;quot;https://cdn.usefathom.com/script.js&amp;quot;
    data-site=&amp;quot;CNOZPPSE&amp;quot;
    defer
  &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;,
];

export const onRenderBody = ({setHeadComponents}) =&amp;gt; {
  setHeadComponents(headComponents);
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. React Helmet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using React Helmet is another method for adding the script as part of the statically generated pages. However, it makes it easy to include the script only on certain pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kldx6d5XBSE&amp;amp;t=360s&quot;&gt;Jump in to to see React Helmet in action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import {Helmet} from &amp;quot;react-helmet&amp;quot;;

const TweetPageReactHelmet = () =&amp;gt; {
  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;Helmet&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;script async src=&amp;quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/Helmet&amp;gt;

      &amp;lt;section&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;quot;twitter-tweet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
          {/* ... rest of tweet embed code */}
        &amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;{&amp;quot; &amp;quot;}
      &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
};

export default TweetPageReactHelmet;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. &lt;code&gt;document.createElement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to have more control over when a script is loaded. In that case, you can do so by manipulating the DOM inside a &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;onClick&lt;/code&gt; or another event that makes sense...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kldx6d5XBSE&amp;amp;t=619s&quot;&gt;Jump in to see &lt;code&gt;document.createElement&lt;/code&gt; in action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React, {useEffect} from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;

const TweetPageCreateElement = () =&amp;gt; {
  useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
    const script = document.createElement(&amp;quot;script&amp;quot;);
    script.src = &amp;quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&amp;quot;;
    document.head.appendChild(script);
    return () =&amp;gt; {
      script.remove();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;section&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;quot;twitter-tweet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
          {/* ... rest of tweet embed code */}
        &amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
  );
};

export default TweetPageCreateElement;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Have you used any of these?&lt;br&gt;
Do you know of another way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/d834JE_bFog&quot;&gt;yesterday&apos;s stream&lt;/a&gt; helping Mirjam source conference data from Supabase, we briefly touched on fallback routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/d834JE_bFog&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./yt-screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab of the intro&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are fallback routes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a way to render pages for data that Gatsby does not yet sourced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mirjam&apos;s case with Conference Buddy there will be a period between a user submits a conference and a fresh build picks up the conference for static generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that interim time, we can rely on fallback routes using either CSR (Client Side Rendering) or SSR (Server Side Rendering).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not sure if SSR fallback route would be allowed, so I spun up a contrived demo using SSG (Static Site Generation) for sourced YouTube videos and SSR for non-sourced YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gatsby docs does not mention SSR for fallback routes, but it builds and serves locally on my machine. However I must admit I have not yet tested deployment...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SSG Page Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// src/pages/yt/{youTubeEmbed.id}.js

import React from &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;;
import { graphql } from &amp;quot;gatsby&amp;quot;;

import VideoLayout from &amp;quot;../../components/video-layout&amp;quot;;

const SSGVideoPage = ({ data }) =&amp;gt; {

&lt;li&gt;The contrived example on &lt;a href=&quot;https://codesandbox.io/s/demo-ssr-fallback-route-9pteu?file=/src/pages/index.mdx&quot;&gt;CodeSandbox&lt;/a&gt; (CodeSandbox is a little buggy with Gatsby so give it some time/reloads if its messing up...)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;earlier in the week &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1473407109480034311?s=20&quot;&gt;a plethora of &amp;quot;nisser&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; showed up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and this morning I released &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-let-it-snow&quot;&gt;version 1.0.0&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code&gt;Let it snow ❄️❄️❄️&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe one of the key things in software development is getting the data model right...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, quite a few times throughout the stream, he would say: &amp;quot;I wouldn&apos;t worry about that now!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do your best in the initial planning and take the time to refactor the model when needed, but do not let the fear of getting it wrong stop you from getting started with your project!&lt;/p&gt;

Today at 19:00 CET the journey towards Conference Buddy 2.0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ZTIoA298mX4&quot;&gt;begins on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ZTIoA298mX4&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./thumbnail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of the family (Ola, Lillian and Queen Raae), Picure of Mirjam, the Conference Buddy logo and a Gatsby flag on top of a picture of the sea.&quot; title=&quot;YouTube Thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Conference Buddy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conference Buddy is an initiative started by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mirjam_diala&quot;&gt;Mirjam&lt;/a&gt;. Its purpose is to help lessen the anxiety for first-time conference-goers by giving them a chance to get to know other attendees ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the plan?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ola, guests, and I will advise Mirjam while she tackles creating a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conferencebuddy.io/&quot;&gt;conferencebuddy.io&lt;/a&gt; with Gatsby +++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight we&apos;ll have a look at Mirjam&apos;s initial Gatsby setup, talk about her plans for Conference Buddy 2.0 and decide on a next step (aka. homework for Mirjam 🤪).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be a fly on the wall, or an active participant, in the development of Conference Buddy 2.0 by tuning in Thursdays at 19.00 CET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did so by adding soon-to-be-officially released plugin: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@raae/gatsby-plugin-donations&quot;&gt;@raae/gatsby-plugin-donations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin adds a Gatsby Serverless Function you may use to accept pay-what-you-want donations. No ready-made components yet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/lVMNrThbQOM&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/p8jpRT3pfuWiYaxxFBd6tZ/5x35VSxXEfp4U9uLZB7mzm/email&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to test out the developer experience myself. Having Ola walk me through the steps in the readme and keep an eye out for areas to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty happy with the results, but some clarification is needed before it&apos;s ready for an official release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also tackled an issue reported by an early tester:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;404 error when using the supplied example code...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out he was using Gatsby version 3.2, and I had somehow put ^3.0.0 as a valid peer dependency when in fact, support for Gatsby Serverless Functions came with version 3.7 🤦‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was Paul, you might ask? He was living out his dream as an Englishman in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1463979984997990406&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/p8jpRT3pfuWiYaxxFBd6tZ/8U3Jj1493FzCnBg4prnk1c/email&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to test out the new plugin, I would love to hear what you think over in the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./demo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab showing a /api/hello endpoint coming from the demo site and a /api/@raae/gatsby-plugin-donations/hello endpoint coming from the plugin&quot; title=&quot;Demo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Kyle made an off handed comment about it on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/gG9E7ZYbhGo&quot;&gt;unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands&amp;quot; back in June, I have been meaning to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I finally had the time and the use case for exploring 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things tripped me up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The structure of the API-folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugin options are not available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s take a close look, so you do not have to trip up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The structure of the api-folder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your plugin&apos;s functions to be picked up, they must live inside a folder structure mirroring the plugin&apos;s name, not directly in the api-folder as I assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a scoped plugin such as mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/
├─ api/
│  ├─ @raae/
│  │  ├─ gatsby-plugin-donations/
│  │  │  ├─ hello.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a non-scoped plugin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/
├─ api/
│  ├─ gatsby-plugin-donations/
│  │  ├─ hello.js

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugin options are not available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugins are meant to be configured using plugin options, but there is no way to get access to those options from a Gatsby Plugin Function 😿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels like an oversight to me....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1460649528202305541?s=20&quot;&gt;discussion I had with Kyle&lt;/a&gt; about it. It ended withh him suggesting I create an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raae/status/1460649528202305541?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./tweet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Haven&apos;t the convention been to add secrets as plugin options?
Getting them from env vars of course. So that a plugin does not &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; any env vars. &quot; title=&quot;Screengrab of Tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did, or more correctly, I started a discussion under &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/34047&quot;&gt;Ideas / Feature Requests&lt;/a&gt;. Go upvote and add your thoughts!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the time being, Gatsby Functions inside Gatsby Plugins will have to rely on env variables to be configured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Queen Raae&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;​PS:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, I am working on a donations with Stripe plugin. Work in progress can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-donations/pull/6&quot;&gt;found on Github&lt;/a&gt;. I am looking for beta testers! Is that you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our tiny task was to source an about page!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/uOfTcQ6VMwQ&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;youtube-screengrab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Arisa, Ola, Paul and I on stream having a blast&quot; title=&quot;YouYube Screengrab&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we did not source it ourselves. We used Storyblok&apos;s official source plugin. Most of the Content Management Systems have official plugins for sourcin`g. You should use these official plugins, if you are not exploring for skill-building purposes of course 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content in Storyblok can take any form you&apos;d like. You create the schema yourself like you do most Headless CMS. Giving you the flexibility to make the content model you need for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is sourced and added to your Storyblok nodes is a JSON object you&apos;ll find on &lt;code&gt;storyblokEntry.content&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!-- &lt;img src=&quot;./graphql.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GraphQL Query Example&quot; title=&quot;GraphQL Screengrab&quot;&gt; --&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll grab that content on your page, parse it, loop over it, and render the bloks as you go along in a way that makes sense for each block. Or dump it out in a pre-tag to familiarize yourself like we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/p8jpRT3pfuWiYaxxFBd6tZ/u2L1btKnv79Nk2SmWmXiSA/email&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To connect a blok to a specific React component use its component field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/p8jpRT3pfuWiYaxxFBd6tZ/94BAHk5k3sD2vcrW4wzHcy/email&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dumping all the content as JSON on the node does not take advantage of Gatsby&apos;s Data Layer properly. For instance, your images will not be adequately sourced into Gatsby... Hopefully, they&apos;ll figure out a way to improve on this for future versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a fascinating thing happens when you take the time to connect Gatsby and Storyblok properly. You get a **live preview **of how the content will look on your Gatsby page inside the Storyblok editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/p8jpRT3pfuWiYaxxFBd6tZ/mg1gpu7iNwNNtEaYNzcEQz/email&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.storyblok.com/tp/add-a-headless-cms-to-gatsby-5-minutes&quot;&gt;Gatsby + Storyblok tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, or take a peek at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/storyblok/gatsby-storyblok-boilerplate&quot;&gt;Storybok + Gatsby Boilerplate&lt;/a&gt; (with a slightly updated approach).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;
